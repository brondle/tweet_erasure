PREFACE TO A TWENTY VOLUME

SUICIDE NOTE


			for Kellie Jones, born 16 May 1959

			Lately, I’ve become accustomed to the way

			The ground opens up and envelopes me

			Each time I go out to walk the dog.

			Or the broad edged silly music the wind

			Makes when I run for a bus . . .

			Things have come to that.

			And now, each night I count the stars,

			And each night I get the same number.

			And when they will not come to be counted,

			I count the holes they leave.

			Nobody sings anymore.

			And then last night, I tiptoed up

			To my daughter’s room and heard her

			Talking to someone, and when I opened

			The door, there was no one there . . .

			Only she on her knees, peeking into

			Her own clasped hands.

			March 1957





HYMN FOR LANIE POO


			Vous êtes des faux Nègres

			—Rimbaud

			O,

			these wild trees

			will make charming wicker baskets,

			the young woman

			the young black woman

			the young black beautiful woman

			said.

			These wild-assed trees

			will make charming

			wicker baskets.

			(now, I’m putting words in her mouth . . . tch)

			1

			All afternoon

			we watched the cranes

			humping each other

			dropped

			our shadows

			onto the beach

			and covered them over with sand.

			Beware the evil sun . . .

			turn you black

			turn your hair

			crawl your eyeballs

			rot your teeth.

			All afternoon

			we sit around

			near the edge of the city

			hacking open

			crocodile skulls

			sharpening our teeth.

			The god I pray to

			got black boobies

			got steatopygia

			make faces in the moon

			make me a greenpurple &

			maroon winding sheet.

			I wobble out to

			the edge of the water

			give my horny yell

			& 24 elephants

			stomp out of the subway

			with consecrated hardons.

			(watch out for that evil sun

			turn you black)

			My fireface

			my orange

			and fireface

			squat by the flames.

			She had her coming out party

			with 3000 guests

			from all parts of the country.

			Queens, Richmond, Togoland, The Camerooons;

			A white hunter, very unkempt,

			with long hair,

			whizzed in on the end of a vine.

			(spoke perfect english too.)

			“Throw on another goddamned Phoenecian,”

			I yelled, really getting with it.

			John Coltrane arrived with an Egyptian lady.

			he played very well.

			“Throw on another goddamned Phoenecian.”

			We got so drunk (Hulan Jack

			brought his bottle of Thunderbird),

			nobody went hunting

			the next morning.

			2

			o,

			don’t be shy honey.

			we all know

			these wicker baskets

			would make wild-assed trees.

			Monday, I spent most of the day hunting

			Knocked off about six, gulped down a cou-

			ple of monkey foreskins, then took in a

			flick. Got to bed early.

			Tuesday, same thing all day. (Caught a

			mangy lioness with one tit.) Ate.

			Watched television for awhile. Read the

			paper, then hit the sack.

			Wednesday, took the day off.

			Took the wife and kids to the games.

			Read Garmanda’s book, “14 Tribes of

			Ambiguity,” didn’t like it.

			Thursday, we caught a goddamn ape.

			Must’ve weighed about 600 pounds.

			We’ll probably eat ape meat for the

			rest of the month. Christ, I hate

			ape meat.

			Friday, I stayed home with a supposed

			cold. Goofed the whole day trying to

			rethatch the roof. Had run in with

			the landlord.

			We spent the weekend at home.

			I tried to get some sculpting done,

			but nothing came of it. It’s impos-

			sible to be an artist and a bread

			winner at the same time.

			Sometimes I think I oughta chuck

			the whole business.

			3

			The firemasons parade.

			(The sun is using this country

			as a commode.

			Beware the sun, my love.)

			The firemasons are very square.

			They are supposed to be a civic

			and fraternal organization, but

			all they do is have parades and

			stay high. They also wear funny

			looking black hats, which are

			round and have brims. The fire-

			masons are cornballs.

			4

			Each morning

			I go down

			to Gansevoort St.

			and stand on the docks.

			I stare out

			at the horizon

			until it gets up

			and comes to embrace

			me. I

			make believe

			it is my father.

			This is known

			as genealogy.

			5

			We came into the

			silly little church

			shaking our wet raincoats

			on the floor.

			It wasn’t water,

			that made the raincoats

			wet.

			The preacher’s

			conning eyes

			filed when he saw

			the way I walked to-

			wards him; almost

			throwing my hips out

			of whack.

			He screamed,

			He’s wet with the blood of the lamb!!

			And everybody

			got real happy.

			6 (die schwartze Bohemien)

			They laught,

			and religion was something

			he fount in coffee ships, by God.

			It’s not that I got enything

			against cotton, nosiree, by God

			It’s just that . . .

			Man lookatthatblonde

			whewee!

			I think they are not treating us like

			Mr. Lincun said they should

			or Mr. Gandhi

			For that matter. By God.

			ZEN

			is a bitch! Like “Bird” was,

			Cafe Olay

			for me, Miss.

			But white cats can’t swing . . .

			Or the way this guy kept patronizing me—

			like he was Bach or somebody

			Oh, I knew

			John Kasper when he hung around with shades . . .

			She’s a painter, Man.

			It’s just that it’s such a drag to go

			Way uptown for Bar B Cue,

			By God . . .

			How much?

			7

			About my sister.

			(O, generation revered

			above all others.

			O, generation of fictitious

			Ofays

			I revere you . . .

			You are all so beautiful)

			my sister drives a green jaguar

			my sister has her hair done twice a month

			my sister is a school teacher

			my sister took ballet lessons

			my sister has a fine figure: never diets

			my sister doesn’t like to teach in Newark

			because there are too many colored

			in her classes

			my sister hates loud shades

			my sister’s boy friend is a faggot music teacher

			who digs Tschaikovsky

			my sister digs Tschaikovsky also

			it is because of this similarity of interests

			that they will probably get married.

			Smiling & glad/in

			the huge & loveless

			white-anglo sun/of

			benevolent step

			mother America.





IN MEMORY OF RADIO


			Who has ever stopped to think of the divinity of Lamont Cranston?

			(Only Jack Kerouac, that I know of: & me.

			The rest of you probably had on WCBS and Kate Smith,

			Or something equally unattractive.)

			What can I say?

			It is better to have loved and lost

			Than to put linoleum in your living rooms?

			Am I a sage or something?

			Mandrake’s hypnotic gesture of the week?

			(Remember, I do not have the healing powers of Oral Roberts . . .

			I cannot, like F. J. Sheen, tell you how to get saved & rich!

			I cannot even order you to gaschamber satori like Hitler or Goody Knight

			& Love is an evil word.

			Turn it backwards/see, see what I mean?

			An evol word. & besides

			who understands it?

			I certainly wouldn’t like to go out on that kind of limb.

			Saturday mornings we listened to Red Lantern & his undersea folk.

			At 11, Let’s Pretend/& we did/& I, the poet, still do, Thank God!

			What was it he used to say (after the transformation, when he was safe

			& invisible & the unbelievers couldn’t throw stones?) “Heh, heh, heh,

			Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows.”

			O, yes he does

			O, yes he does.

			An evil word it is,

			This Love.





LOOK FOR YOU YESTERDAY,

HERE YOU COME TODAY


			Part of my charm:

			envious blues feeling

			separation of church & state

			grim calls from drunk debutantes

			Morning never aids me in my quest.

			I have to trim my beard in solitude.

			I try to hum lines from “The Poet In New York”.

			People saw metal all around the house on Saturdays. The Phone rings.

			terrible poems come in the mail. Descriptions of celibate parties

			torn trousers: Great Poets dying

			with their strophes on. & me

			incapable of a simple straightforward anger.

			It’s so diffuse

			being alive. Suddenly one is aware

			that nobody really gives a damn.

			My wife is pregnant with her child.

			“It means nothing to me”, sez Strindberg.

			An avalanche of words

			could cheer me up. Words from Great Sages.

			Was James Karolis a great sage??

			Why did I let Ora Matthews beat him up

			in the bathroom? Haven’t I learned my lesson.

			I would take up painting

			If I cd think of a way to do it

			better than Leonardo. Than Bosch

			Than Hogarth. Than Kline.

			Frank walked off the stage, singing

			“My silence is as important as Jack’s incessant yatter.”

			I am a mean hungry sorehead.

			Do I have the capacity for grace??

			To arise one smoking spring

			& find one’s youth has taken off

			for greener parts.

			A sudden blankness in the day

			as if there were no afternoon.

			& all my piddling joys retreated

			to their own dopey mythic worlds.

			The hours of the atmosphere

			grind their teeth like hags.

			(When will world war two be over?)

			I stood up on a mailbox

			waving my yellow tee-shirt

			watching the grey tanks

			stream up Central Ave.

			All these thots

			are Flowers Of Evil

			cold & lifeless

			as subway rails

			the sun like a huge cobblestone

			flaking its brown slow rays

			primititi

			once, twice, . My life

			seems over & done with.

			Each morning I rise

			like a sleep walker

			& rot a little more.

			All the lovely things I’ve known have disappeared.

			I have all my pubic hair & am lonely.

			There is probably no such place as BattleCreek, Michigan!

			Tom Mix dead in a Boston Nightclub

			before I realized what happened.

			People laugh when I tell them about Dickie Dare!

			What is one to do in an alien planet

			where the people breath New Ports?

			Where is my space helmet, I sent for it

			3 lives ago . . . when there were box tops.

			What has happened to box tops??

			O, God . . . I must have a belt that glows green

			in the dark. Where is my Captain Midnight decoder??

			I can’t understand what Superman is saying!

			THERE MUST BE A LONE RANGER!!!

			****

			but this also

			is part of my charm.

			A maudlin nostalgia

			that comes on

			like terrible thoughts about death.

			How dumb to be sentimental about anything

			To call it love

			& cry pathetically

			into the long black handkerchief

			of the years.

			“Look for you yesterday

			Here you come today

			Your mouth wide open

			But what you got to say?”

			—part of my charm

			old envious blues feeling

			ticking like a big cobblestone clock.

			I hear the reel running out . . .

			the spectators are impatient for popcorn:

			It was only a selected short subject

			F. Scott Charon

			will soon be glad-handing me

			like a legionaire

			My silver bullets all gone

			My black mask trampled in the dust

			& Tonto way off in the hills

			moaning like Bessie Smith.





TO A PUBLISHER . . . CUT-OUT


			The blight rests in your face.

			For your unknown musiks. The care & trust

			Undeliberate. Like an axe-murder

			Or flat pancake. The night cold & asexual

			A long sterile moon lapping at the dank Hudson.

			The end of a star. The water more than any

			Other thing. We are dibbled here. Seurat’s

			Madness. That kind of joke. Isolate

			Land creatures in a wet unfriendly world.

			We must be strong. (smoke Balkan Sobranie)

			People will think you have the taste

			In this hyar family. Some will stroke your face.

			Better posture is another thing. Watch out for Peanuts,

			he’s gonna turn out bad/ A J.D./ A Beatnik! A

			Typical wise-ass N.Y. kid. “X” wanted to bet me

			that Charlie Brown spent most of his time

			whacking his doodle, or having weird relations

			with that dopey hound of his (though that’s

			a definite improvement over “Arf Arf” & that

			filthy little lesbian hes hung up with.)

			As if any care could see us through. Could defend us.

			Save us from you, Little Darling. Or me, which is worse.

			“A far far worser thing I do/than I has ever done”.

			Put that in your pipe & watch out for the gendarmes.

			They arresses people for less than that. For less

			Than we are ever capable of. Any kind of sincerity

			Guarantees complete disregard. Complete abnegation.

			“Must dig with my fingers/as nobody will lend me

			or sell me a pick axe.” Axe the man who owns one.

			Hellzapoppin. The stars might not come on tonight . . .

			& who the hell can do anything about that?? Eh,

			Milord/ Milady/ The kind Dubarry wasn’t. Tres slick.

			But who am I to love anybody? I ride the 14th St. bus

			every day . . . reading Hui neng/ Raymond Chandler! Olson . . .

			I have slept with almost every mediocre colored woman

			On 23rd St . . . At any rate, talked a good match. And

			Frightened by the lack of any real communication

			I addressed several perfumed notes to Uncle Don

			& stuffed them into the radio. In the notes,

			Of course, crude assignations, off color suggestions,

			Diagrams of new methods for pederasts, lewd poems

			That rime. IF ONLY HE WOULD READ THESE ON THE AIR.

			(There are other things could take my mind from

			this childe’s play . . . but none nearly as interesting.)

			I long to be a mountain climber

			& wave my hands up 8,000 feet.

			Out of sight & snow blind/the tattered

			Stars and Stripes poked in the new peak.

			& come down later, Clipper by my side,

			To new wealth & eternal fame. That

			Kind of care. I could wear

			Green corduroy coats & felt tyroleans

			For the rest of my days; & belong to clubs.

			Grandeur in boldness. Big & stupid as the wind.

			But so lovely. Who’s to understand that kind of con?

			As if each day, after breakfast, someone asked you,

			“What do you want to be when you grow up??” &

			Day in, Day out, you just kept belching.





OSTRICHES & GRANDMOTHERS!


			All meet here with us, finally: the

			uptown, way-west, den of inconstant

			moralities.

			Faces up: all

			my faces turned up

			to the sun.

			1

			Summer’s mist nods against the trees

			till distance grows in my head

			like an antique armada

			dangled motionless from the horizon.

			Unbelievable changes. Restorations.

			Each day like my niña’s fan

			tweaking the flat air

			back and forth till the room

			is a blur of flowers.

			Intimacy takes on human form . . .

			& sheds it like a hide.

			Lips, eyes,

			tiny lace coughs

			reflected on night’s stealth.

			2

			Tonight, one star.

			eye of the dragon.

			The Void

			signaling.

			Reminding someone

			it’s still there.

			3

			It’s these empty seconds

			I fill with myself. Each

			a recognition. A complete

			utterance.

			Here, it is color; motion;

			the feeling of dazzling beauty

			Flight.

			As

			the trapeze rider

			leans

			with arms spread

			wondering at the bar’s

			delay





SCENARIO VI


			. . . and I come out of it

			with this marvelous yellow cane

			in my hand, yellow cashmere jacket

			green felt pants & green boater . . . & green &

			black clack shoes, polished & fast, jiggling

			in the wings . . . till Vincente says “rollllem”

			& I jiggle out on the stage, hands in my pockets,

			the cane balanced delicately under my arm, spinning

			& clack clack clacking across the bare sunday clothesline

			tilting the hat to avoid the sun & ginergerly missing

			the dried branch I had put there yesterday.

			The motion of the mind! Smooooth; I jiggle

			& clack stomping one foot & the clothesline swings.

			Fabulei Verwachsenes. Ripping this one off

			in a series of dramatic half-turns I learned

			many years ago in the orient; Baluba:

			“The power to cloud men’s minds” &c., which

			I’m sure you must have heard about, doodle-doo.

			& then I’m sitting in this red chair, humming,

			feet still pecking at the marble floor, the

			line motionless with only the tiniest leaf

			on the dead branch waving, slowly, with a red background,

			& I can’t see anything, only hear this raspy 1936 voice

			singing in german a very groovy love song; to me.

			There’s a train whistle, too. In and out like this.

			When out the open window of early spring, sharp

			browns & greens fuzzy through the shade

			& a fence somehow too bleak to describe, or even

			be made sad by.

			& I’m not even breathing hard. Tapping my feet

			so nicely, the cane too, on the red marble. No

			echo, that’s distant thunder for these early summer storms,

			cools off the whole scene too. But waiting

			for my next cue, Vincente comes over, lights my cigarette,

			We make a date for next wednesday, at the rainbow hut,

			& he has a fabulous cigarette holder. & he pats

			my cane-hand & says, “you do it up, baby”. I’m on again.

			Sylvia has come out in her smashing oranges & jewelry,

			she has her mouth wide & I can hear her listening to

			my feet clackings for her deep beauty doesn’t include

			rhythm. But we make it in great swirls out to the terrace,

			which overlooks Sumer . . . & the Indus river, where next

			week probably all kinds of white trash will ride in

			on stolen animals we will be amazed by.





WAY OUT WEST


			for Gary Snyder

			As simple an act

			as opening the eyes. Merely

			coming into things by degrees.

			Morning: some tear is broken

			on the wooden stairs

			of my lady’s eyes. Profusions

			of green. The leaves. Their

			constant prehensions. Like old

			junkies on Sheridan Square, eyes

			cold and round. There is a song

			Nat Cole sings . . . This city

			& the intricate disorder

			of the seasons.

			Unable to mention

			something as abstract as time.

			Even so, (bowing low in thick

			smoke from cheap incense; all

			kinds questions filling the mouth,

			till you suffocate & fall dead

			to opulent carpet.) Even so,

			shadows will creep over your flesh

			& hide your disorder, your lies.

			There are unattractive wild ferns

			outside the window

			where the cats hide. They yowl

			from there at nights. In heat

			& bleeding on my tulips.

			Steel bells, like the evil

			unwashed Sphinx, towing in the twilight.

			Childless old murderers, for centuries

			with musty eyes.

			I am distressed. Thinking

			of the seasons, how they pass,

			how I pass, my very youth, the

			ripe sweet of my life; drained off . . .

			Like giant rhesus monkeys;

			picking their skulls,

			with ingenious cruelty

			sucking out the brains.

			No use for beauty

			collapsed, with moldy breath

			done in. Insidious weight

			of cankered dreams. Tiresias’

			weathered cock.

			Walking into the sea, shells

			caught in the hair. Coarse

			waves tearing the tongue.

			Closing the eyes. As

			simple an act. You float





THE BRIDGE


			for wieners & mcclure

			I have forgotten the head

			of where I am. Here at the bridge. 2

			bars, down the street, seeming

			to wrap themselves around my fingers, the day,

			screams in me; pitiful like a little girl

			you sense will be dead before the winter

			is over.

			I can’t see the bridge now, I’ve past

			it, its shadow, we drove through, headed out

			along the cold insensitive roads to what

			we wanted to call “ourselves.”

			“How does the bridge go?” Even tho

			you find yourself in its length

			strung out along its breadth, waiting

			for the cold sun to tear out your eyes. Enamoured

			of its blues, spread out in the silk clubs of

			this autumn tune. The changes are difficult, when

			you hear them, & know they are all in you, the chords

			of your disorder meddle with your would be disguises.

			Sifting in, down, upon your head, with the sun & the insects.

			(Late feeling) Way down till it barely, after that rush of

			wind & odor reflected from hills you have forgotten the color

			when you touch the water, & it closes, slowly, around your head.

			The bridge will be behind you, that music you know, that place,

			you feel when you look up to say, it is me, & I have forgotten,

			all the things, you told me to love, to try to understand, the

			bridge will stand, high up in the clouds & the light, & you,

			(when you have let the song run out) will be sliding through

			unmentionable black.





VICE


			Sometimes I feel I have to express myself

			and then, whatever it is I have to express

			falls out of my mouth like flakes of ash

			from a match book that the drunken guest

			at the grey haired jew lady’s birthday party has

			set on fire, for fun & to ease the horrible boredom.

			& when these flakes amass, I make serious collages

			or empty them (feinting a gratuitous act) out the window

			on the heads of the uncurious puerto rican passersby.

			ACT I. The celibate bandit pees in the punch bowl.

			(curious image) occurring friday evening, a house

			full of middle class women & a photogenic baker.

			Baby bear has eaten her porridge, had her bath, shit

			& gone to sleep. Smoke rises (strange for mid-summer)

			out of a strange little shack in the middle of the

			torn down cathedral. Everything seems to be light green.

			I suppose, a color of despair or wretchedness. Anyway,

			everything is light green, even the curling little hairs

			on the back of my hand, and the old dog scar glinting

			in the crooked (green, light green) rays of an unshaded bulb.

			There doesn’t seem to be any act 2. The process is stopped.

			Functional, as a whip, a strong limb broken off in the gale

			lying twisty & rotten, unnoticed in my stone back yard.

			All this means nothing is happening to me (in this world).

			I suppose some people are having a ball. Organized fun.

			Pot Smokers Institute is going on an outing tomorrow; my

			corny sister, in her fake bohemian pants, is borrowing something

			else. (A prestige item). These incomprehensible dullards!

			Asked to be special, & alive in the mornings, if they are green

			& I am still alive, (& green) hovering above all the things I

			seem to want to be a part of (curious smells, the high-noon idea

			of life . . . a crowded train station where they broadcast a slice,

			just one green slice, of some glamourous person’s life).

			& I cant even isolate my pleasures. All the things I can talk about

			mean nothing to me.

			This is not rage. (I am not that beautiful!) Only immobile coughs

			& gestures towards somethings I don’t understand. If I were lucky

			enough to still be an adolescent, I’d just attribute these weird

			singings in my intestine to sex, & slink off merrily to mastur

			bate. Mosaic of disorder I own but cannot recognize. Mist in me.

			There must be some great crash in the slinky world: MYSTIC CURE . . .

			Cunning panacea of the mind. The faith of it. the singed hairs

			of human trust, corrupt & physical as a disease. A glass stare.

			Resolution, for the quick thrust of epee, to force your opponent

			cringing against the wall, not in anger, but unfettered happiness

			while your lady is watching from the vined balcony, your triumph.

			& years after, you stand in subways watching your invincible hand

			bring the metal to bear again & again, when you are old & the lady,

			(o, fond memories we hide in our money belts, & will not spend)

			the lady, you young bandits who have not yet stolen your first purse

			the lady will be dead.

			And if you are alone (if there is something in you so cruel)

			You will wonder at the extravagance

			of youth.





SYMPHONY SID


			First

			take the first

			thing. Blue. The mountain,

			largest of our

			landscape. From

			a dark hall at

			the bottom, the shapes

			a shadow, without

			hardness, or that

			ugly smell of

			blackening flesh.

			The scale

			is music, black shadow

			from highest wild

			fingers placing evening

			beneath our

			tongues.

			A man, a woman

			shaking the night apart. Forget

			who you are. Forget

			my fingers.





BETANCOURT


			for Rubi

			What are

			influences?

			A green truck

			wet & glowing, seance

			of ourselves, elegy for the sea

			at night, my flesh

			a woman’s, at the fingertips

			soft white increased coolness

			from the dark

			sea.

			We sat

			with our backs

			to the sea. Not

			in the gardens

			of Spain, but some

			new greenness, birds

			scorching the yellow

			rocks at the foot

			of the sea’s wall. A barrier

			of rock, tilting backwards, damp,

			thrown up against

			a floating dreary

			disgust. Even fear

			without that self possession. The

			night’s defection. Walking all night

			entwined inside, I mean

			I tasted you, your real & fleshy

			voice

			inside my head

			& choked

			as if some primitive

			corruption re-sat

			itself in full view

			of a puritan flame. And flame

			is the mind, the wet hands

			mark on strange islands

			of warmth.

			Big stone nose, nigger

			lips, the entire head

			thrust from

			a serpents snout. Idle

			somehow, fire scorching

			the plain earth we pulled

			up around thinking

			to limit its violence. To

			contain even that

			madness (within

			some thrown wall

			of words.)

			Our gestures

			are silence. The sea’s

			wet feathers slowly

			black. (You die

			from mornings, looking down

			from that silence

			at the silence

			of roofs. Disconnected

			flesh. Not even cars

			from this distance

			are real.

			2

			This

			is slower. Infused (somehow)

			with sound

			& distance. Slow

			the cock

			flat

			on skin

			like

			a dead

			insect. A

			bee, with

			crushed

			antlers,

			sprawled

			on its side,

			And last night, talking to ourselves, except

			when some wildness

			cut us, ripped impossibly

			deep beneath black

			flesh

			to black bone. Then

			we loved each other. Understood

			the miles of dead air

			between our

			softest parts. French girl

			from the desert. Desert man,

			whose mind is some rotting

			country of snow.

			3

			There is more

			underneath. Rotted, green

			beneath hands making

			their deadly wishes

			show. La casa. El edificio. La

			Mar. El hombre. Without seething

			tin braziers, no, those weird cups

			in novels: chalices.

			I was reading

			some old man’s poems

			this morning. A lover

			hid himself under

			the stink of low trailing

			sea birds, heavy sun, pure

			distance. He had to go away,

			I mean, from all of us, even

			you, marvelous person

			at the sea’s edge. Even you

			Sra. de Jiminez. Rubi.

			And

			I think he knew

			all this would happen, that

			when I dropped the book

			the sky would have already

			moved, turned black, and

			wet grey air

			would mark the windows.

			That

			there are fools

			who hang close

			to their original

			thought. Elementals

			of motion (Not, again,

			that garden) but some

			slightness

			of feeling

			they think is sweet

			and long to die

			inside.

			Think

			about it! As even

			this, now, a turning

			away. (I mean I think

			I know now

			what a poem

			is) A

THE INSIDIOUS DR. FU MAN CHU


			If I think myself

			strong, then I am

			not true to the misery

			in my life. The uncertainty.

			(of what I am saying, who

			I have chose to become, the

			very air pressing my skin

			held gently away, this woman

			and the one I taste continually

			in my nebular pallet tongue face

			mouth feet, standing in piles

			of numbers, hills, lovers.

			If

			I think myself ugly

			& go to the mirror, smiling,

			at the inaccuracy, or now

			the rain pounds dead grass

			in the stone yard, I think

			how very wise I am. How very

			very wise.





THE NEW SHERIFF


			There is something

			in me so cruel, so

			silent. It hesitates

			to sit on the grass

			with the young white

			virgins

			of my time. The blood-

			letter, clothed in what

			it is. Elemental essence,

			animal grace, not that, but

			a rude stink of color

			huger, more vast, than

			this city suffocating. Red

			street. Waters noise

			in the ear, inside

			the hard bone

			of the brain. Inside

			the soft white meat

			of the feelings. Inside

			your flat white stomach

			I move my tongue





FROM AN ALMANAC

BALBOA, THE ENTERTAINER


			It cannot come

A CONTRACT. (FOR THE DESTRUCTION AND REBUILDING OF PATERSON


			Flesh, and cars, tar, dug holes beneath stone

			a rude hierarchy of money, band saws cross out

			music, feeling. Even speech, corrodes.

			I came here

			from where I sat boiling in my veins, cold fear

			at the death of men, the death of learning, in

			cold fear, at my own. Romantic vests of same death

			blank at the corner, blank when they raise their fingers

			Criss the hearts, in dark flesh staggered so marvelous

			are their lies. So complete, their mastery, of these

			stupid niggers. Loud spics kill each other, and will not

			make the simple trip to Tiffany’s. Will not smash their stainless

			heads, against the simpler effrontery of so callous a code as gain.

			You are no brothers, dirty woogies, dying under dried rinds, in massa’s

			droopy tuxedos. Cab Calloways of the soul, at the soul’s juncture, a

			music, they think will save them from our eyes. (In back of the terminal

			where the circus will not go. At the backs of crowds, stooped and vulgar

			breathing hate syllables, unintelligible rapes of all that linger in

			our new world. Killed in white fedora hats, they stand so mute at what

			whiter slaves did to my father. They muster silence. They pray at the

			steps of abstract prisons, to be kings, when all is silence, when all

			is stone. When even the stupid fruit of their loins is gold, or something

			else they cannot eat.





THIS IS THE CLEARING I ONCE SPOKE OF


			The talk scared him. Left alone, with me,

			at some water. (Suddenness of your mind,

			because you will be saved. Stand there

			counting deaths. My own, is what I wanted

			you to say, Roi, you will die soon.)

			And

			it went well, till evening, and the birds

			fled. Their trees hanging empty at the

			river. All of it a creation. More than

			ideas. The simple elegant hand, a man

			will extend. More than we can lose, and

			still talk lovingly of “ourselves.”

			The brush sank behind its silence. This

			was a jungle, dead children of thought.

			We sat looking, and the wind changed

			our fire, it was blue, and sang slowly.

			Whose mind has this here? The way love

			will move. I love you, I say that now

			evenly, without emotion. Having

			lost you. Or sitting, at the ruptured

			threads of light. Wind and birds, spurn

			out over the water, silent or dead.





A POEM FOR NEUTRALS


			A japanese neon landscape blinks

			a constant film

			of memory. His leaves, his hills

			change in dumb perspective. Farmers

			and Americans,

			say they are blue. Some natural phenomenon

			some possible image

			of what we shall call history. A jungle

			of feeling. In their minds, the broken

			tree, wet blood in the romantic’s bulb. our sudden

			and misconceived beauty. Inept tenderness. (For

			those long girls lay in darkness under our smell.

			Those talkers who will not shut up

			when the dawn comes. And stand in doorways

			letting cold air blow in.

			It is a history of motive,

			as secure as the economy

			for these restless dwarfs

			performing miracles for the blind. The wet ring

			on their pants

			the menace

			of our education. It is not Dante,

			nor Yeats. But the loud and drunken

			pilgrim, I knew so well

			in my youth. And grew to stone

			waiting for the change.

			2

			The calendar is memory. The dead roots

			of the poet’s brain. Yellow skin, black

			skin, or the formless calm of compromise. They will not come

			to see, or understand you. They will call you “murderer,”

			as new songs for their young. The mountains

			in your country, the flat skies of mine. (Except

			by the oceans, the poor hate their shadows,

			and force their agony to dance.

			All night blue leaves ring

			in Kyoto. And the windows of 5th street

			scream.





AN AGONY. AS NOW


			I am inside someone

			who hates me. I look

			out from his eyes. Smell

			what fouled tunes come in

			to his breath. Love his

			wretched women.

			Slits in the metal, for sun. Where

			my eyes sit turning, at the cool air

			the glance of light, or hard flesh

			rubbed against me, a woman, a man,

			without shadow, or voice, or meaning.

			This is the enclosure (flesh,

			where innocence is a weapon. An

			abstraction. Touch. (Not mine.

			Or yours, if you are the soul I had

			and abandoned when I was blind and had

			my enemies carry me as a dead man

			(if he is beautiful, or pitied.

			It can be pain. (As now, as all his

			flesh hurts me.) It can be that. Or

			pain. As when she ran from me into

			that forest.

			Or pain, the mind

			silver spiraled whirled against the

			sun, higher than even old men thought

			God would be. Or pain. And the other. The

			yes. (Inside his books, his fingers. They

			are withered yellow flowers and were never

			beautiful.) The yes. You will, lost soul, say

			‘beauty.’ Beauty, practiced, as the tree. The

			slow river. A white sun in its wet sentences.

			Or, the cold men in their gale. Ecstasy. Flesh

			or soul. The yes. (Their robes blown. Their bowls

			empty. They chant at my heels, not at yours.) Flesh

			or soul, as corrupt. Where the answer moves too quickly.

			Where the God is a self, after all.)

			Cold air blown through narrow blind eyes. Flesh,

			white hot metal. Glows as the day with its sun.

			It is a human love, I live inside. A bony skeleton

			you recognize as words or simple feeling.

			But it has no feeling. As the metal, is hot, it is not,

			given to love.

			It burns the thing

			inside it. And that thing

			screams.





A POEM FOR WILLIE BEST********


			I

			The face sings, alone

			at the top

			of the body. All

			flesh, all song, aligned. For hell

			is silent, at those cracked lips

			flakes of skin and mind

			twist and whistle softly

			as they fall.

			It was your own death

			you saw. Your own face, stiff

			and raw. This

			without sound, or

			movement. Sweet afton, the

			dead beggar bleeds

			yet. His blood, for a time

			alive, and huddled in a door

			way, struggling to sing. Rain

			washes it into cracks. Pits

			whose bottoms are famous. Whose sides

			are innocent broadcasts

			of another life.

			At this point, neither

			front nor back. A point, the

			dimensionless line. The top

			of a head, seen from Christ’s

			heaven, stripped of history

			or desire.

			Fixed, perpendicular

			to shadow. (even speech, vertical,

			leaves no trace. Born in to death

			held fast to it, where

			the lover spreads his arms, the line

			he makes to threaten Gods with history.

			The fingers stretch to emptiness. At

			each point, after flesh, even light

			is speculation. But an end, his end,

			failing a beginning.

			A cross. The gesture, symbol, line

			arms held stiff, nailed stiff, with

			no sign, of what gave them strength.

			The point, become a line, a cross, or

			the man, and his material, driven in

			the ground. If the head rolls back

			and the mouth opens, screamed into

			existence, there will be perhaps

			only the slightest hint of movement—

			a smear; no help will come. No one

			will turn to that station again.

JOSEPH TO HIS BROTHERS


			They characterize

			with mine. Fill up

			with what I have, with what

			I see (or

			need. I make

			no distinction. As blind men

			cannot love too quiet beauty.

			their boats. Bring

			their gifts, weapons

			pushing

			the grass flat.

SHORT SPEECH TO MY FRIENDS


			A political art, let it be

			tenderness, low strings the fingers

			touch, or the width of autumn

			climbing wider avenues, among the virtue

			and dignity of knowing what city

			you’re in, who to talk to, what clothes

			—even what buttons—to wear. I address

			/ the society

			the image, of

			common utopia.

			/ The perversity

			of separation, isolation,

			after so many years of trying to enter their kingdoms,

			now they suffer in tears, these others, saxophones whining

			through the wooden doors of their less than gracious homes.

			The poor have become our creators. The black. The thoroughly

			ignorant.

			Let the combination of morality

			and inhumanity

			begin.

			2.

			Is power, the enemy? (Destroyer

			of dawns, cool flesh of valentines, among

			the radios, pauses, drunks

			of the 19th century. I see it,

			as any man’s single history. All the possible heroes

			dead from heat exhaustion

			at the beach

			or hiding for years from cameras

			only to die cheaply in the pages

			of our daily lie.

			One hero

			has pretensions toward literature

			one toward the cultivation of errors, arrogance,

			and constantly changing disguises, as trucker, boxer,

			valet, barkeep, in the aging taverns of memory. Making love

			to those speedy heroines of masturbation or kicking literal evil

			continually down filmy public stairs.

			A compromise

			would be silence. To shut up, even such risk

			as the proper placement

			of verbs and nouns. To freeze the spit

			in mid-air, as it aims itself

			at some valiant intellectual’s face.

			There would be someone

			who would understand, for whatever

			fancy reason. Dead, lying, Roi, as your children

			came up, would also rise. As George Armstrong Custer

			these 100 years, has never made

			of our doubt, whatever slow thought

			comes to rest, beneath the silence

			of starving talk.

			Just their fingers’ prints

			staining the cold glass, is sufficient

			for commerce, and a proper ruling on

			humanity. You know the pity

			of democracy, that we must sit here

			and listen to how he made his money.

			Tho the catalogue of his possible ignorance

			roars and extends through the room

			like fire. “Love,” becomes the pass,

			the word taken intimately to combat

			all the uses of language. So that learning

			What they have gathered into themselves

			in that short mean trip from mother’s iron tit

			to those faggot handmaidens of the french whore

			who wades slowly in the narrows, waving her burnt out

			torch. There are movies, and we have opinions. There are

			regions of compromise so attractive, we daily long

			to filthy our minds with their fame. And all the songs

			of our handsome generation fall clanging like stones

			in the empty darkness of their heads.

			Couples, so beautiful

			in the newspapers, marauders of cheap sentiment. So much taste

			so little understanding, except some up and coming queer explain

			cinema and politics while drowning a cigarette.

			3

			They are more ignorant than the poor

			tho they pride themselves with that accent. And

			move easily in fake robes of egalitarianism. Meaning,

			I will fuck you even if you don’t like art. And are wounded

			that you call their italian memories petit bourgeois.

			Whose death

			will be Malraux’s? Or the names Senghor, Price, Baldwin

			whispered across the same dramatic pancakes, to let each eyelash flutter

			at the news of their horrible deaths. It is a cheap game

			to patronize the dead, unless their deaths be accountable

			to your own understanding. Which be nothing nothing

			if not bank statements and serene trips to our ominous countryside.

			Nothing, if not whining talk about handsome white men. Nothing

			if not false glamourous and static. Except, I admit, your lives

			are hideously real.

			4

			The source of their art crumbles into legitimate history.

			The whimpering pigment of a decadent economy, slashed into life

			as Yeats’ mad girl plummeting over the nut house wall, her broken

			knee caps rattling in the weather, reminding us of lands

			our antennae do not reach.

			And there are people in these savage geographies

FOOTNOTE TO A PRETENTIOUS BOOK


			Who am I to love

			so deeply? As against

			a heavy darkness, pressed

			against my eyes. Wetting

			my face, a constant trembling

			rain.

			A long life, to you. My friend. I

			tell that to myself, slowly, sucking

			my lip. A silence of motives / empties

			the day of meaning.

			What is intimate

			enough? What is

			beautiful?

			It is slow unto meaning for

			any life. If I am an animal, there

			is proof of my living. The fawns

			and calves

			of my age. But it is steel that falls

			as a thin mist into my consciousness. As a fine

			ugly spray, I have made

			some futile ethic

			with.

			“Changed my life?” As the dead man

			pacing at the edge of the sea. As

			the lips, closed

			for so long, at the sight

			of motionless

			birds.

			There is no one to entrust with

			meaning. (These sails go by, these small

			deadly animals.)

			And meaning? These words?

			Were there some blue expanse

			of world. Some other

			flesh, resting

			at the roof

			of the world . . .

			you could say of me,

			that I was truly

			simpleminded.

			full of porters I ran track with, effeminate blues singers, the wealth

			of the nation transposed into the ring of my flesh’s image. Grand dancers

			spray noise and disorder in these old tombs. Liverwurst sandwiches dry

			on brown fenced-in lawns, unfinished cathedrals tremble with our screams.

			Of the dozens, the razor, the cloth, the sheen, all speed adventure locked

			in my eyes. I give you now, to love me, if I spare what flesh of yours

			is left. If I see past what I feel, and call music simply “Art” and will

			not take it to its logical end. For the death by hanging, for

			the death by the hooded political murderer, for the old man dead in his

			tired factory; election machines chime quietly his fraudulent faith.

			For the well that marks the burned stores. For the deadly idiot of compromise

			who shrieks compassion, and bids me love my neighbor. Even beyond the meaning

			of such act as would give all my father’s dead ash to fertilize their bilious

			land. Such act as would give me legend, “This is the man who saved us

			Spared us from the disappearance of the sixteenth note, the destruction

			of the scale. This is the man who against the black pits of despairing genius

			cried, “Save the Popular Song.” For them who pat me in the huddle and do not

			argue at the plays. For them who finish second and are happy they are Chinese,

			and need not run those 13 blocks.

			I am not moved. I will not move to save them. There is no

			“melody.” Only the foot stomped, the roaring harmonies of need. The

			hand banged on the table, waved in the air. The teeth pushed against

			the lip. The face and fingers sweating. “Let me alone,” is praise enough

			for these musicians.

			3

			My own mode of conscience. And guilt, always the obvious connection.

			They spread you in the sun, and leave you there, one of a kind, who

			has no sons to tell this to. The mind so bloated at its own judgment. The

			railing consequence of energy given in silence. Ideas whose sole place

			is where they form. The language less than the act. The act so far beyond

			itself, meaning all forms, all modes, all voices, chanting for safety.

			I am deaf and blind and lost and still not again sing your quiet verse. I have lost

			even the act of poetry, and writhe now for cool horizonless dawn. The

			shake and chant, bulled electric motion, figure of what there will be

			as it sits beside me waiting to live past my own meekness. My own

			light skin. Bull of yellow perfection, imperfectly made, imperfectly

			understood, except as it rises against the mountains, like sun

			but brighter, like flame but hotter. There will be those

			who will tell you it will be beautiful.





CROW JANE


			“Crow Jane, Crow Jane, don’t hold your head so high,

			You realize, baby, you got to lay down and die.”

			—Mississippi Joe Williams





FOR CROW JANE

(MAMA DEATH.


			For dawn, wind

			off the river. Wind

			and light, from

			the lady’s hand. Cold

			stuff, placed against

			strong man’s lips. Young gigolo’s

			of the 3rd estate. Young ruffians

			without no homes. The wealth

			is translated, corrected, a

			dark process, like thought, tho

			it provide a landscape

			with golden domes.

			“Your people

			without love.” And life

			rots them. Makes a silence

			blankness in every space

			flesh thought to be. (First light,

			is dawn. Cold stuff

			to tempt a lover. Old lady

			of flaking eyes. Moon lady

			of useless thighs.





CROW JANE’S MANNER.


			Is some pilgrimage

			to thought. Where she goes, in fairness,

			“nobody knows.” And then, without love,

			returns to those wrinkled stomachs

			ragged bellies / of young ladies

			gone with seed. Crow

			will not have. Dead virgin

			of the mind’s echo. Dead lady

			of thinking, back now, without

			the creak of memory.

			Field is yellow. Fils dead

			(Me, the last . . . black lip hung

			in dawn’s gray wind. The last,

			for love, a taker, took my kin.

			Crow. Crow. Where

			you leave my

			other boys?





CROW JANE IN HIGH SOCIETY.


			(Wipes

			her nose

			on the draperies. Spills drinks

			fondles another man’s

			life. She is looking

			for alternatives. Openings

			where she can lay all

			this greasy talk

			on somebody. Me, once. Now

			I am her teller.

			(And I tell

			her symbols, as the grey movement

			of clouds. Leave

			grey movements

			of clouds. Leave, always,

			more.

			Where is she? That she

			moves without light. Even

			in our halls. Even with

			our laughter, lies, dead drunk

			in a slouch hat famous king.

			Where?

			To come on so.





CROW JANE THE CROOK.


			Of the night

			of the rain, she

			reigned, reined, her

			fat whores and horse.

			(A cloud burst,

			and wet us. The mountain

			split, and burned us. We thought

			we were done.

			Jane.

			Wet lady of no image. We

			thought, you had left us. Dark

			lady, of constant promise. We thought

			you had gone.

			2.

			My heart is cast in bitter

			metal. Condiments, spices

			all the frustration of earth,

			that has so much more desire

			than resolution. Want than pleasure.

			Oh, Jane. (Her boat bumps at the ragged

			shore. Soul of the ocean, go out, return.

			Oh, Jane, we thought you had gone.





THE DEAD LADY CANONIZED.


			(A thread

			of meaning. Meaning light. The quick

			response. To breath, or the virgins

			sick odor against the night.

			(A trail

			of objects. Dead nouns, rotted faces

			propose the nights image. Erect

			for that lady, a grave of her own.

			(The stem

			of the morning, sets itself, on

			each window ( of thought, where it

			goes. The lady is dead, may the Gods,

			(those others

			beg our forgiveness. And Damballah, kind father,

			sew up

			her bleeding hole.





DUNCAN SPOKE OF A PROCESS


			And what I have learned

			of it, to repeat, repeated

			as a day will repeat

			its color, the tired sounds

			run off its bones. In me, a balance.

			Before that, what came easiest. From

			wide poles, across the greenest earth,

			eyes locked on, where they could live, and

			whatever came from there, where the hand

			could be offered, like Gideon’s young troops

			on their knees at the water.

			I test myself,

			with memory. A live bloody skeleton. Hung as softly

			as summer. Sways like words’ melody, as ugly as any

			lips, or fingers stroking lakes, or flesh like a

			white frightened scream.

			What comes, closest, is

			closest. Moving, there

			is a wreck of spirit,

			a heap of broken feeling. What

			was only love

			or in those cold rooms,

			opinion. Still, it made

			color. And filled me

			as no one will. As, even

			I cannot fill

			myself.

			I see what I love most and will not

			leave what futile lies

			I have. I am where there

			is nothing, save myself. And go out to

			what is most beautiful. What some noncombatant Greek

			or soft Italian prince

			would sing, “Noble Friends.”

			Noble Selves. And which one

			is truly

			to rule here? And

			what country is this?





AUDUBON, DRAFTED


			for Linda

			It does not happen. That love, removes

			itself. (I am leaving, Goodbye!

			Removes

			itself, as rain, hard iron rain

			comes down, then stops. All those

			eyes opened for morning, close with

			what few hours given them. With tears,

			or at a stone wall, shadows drag down.

			I am what I think I am. You are what

			I think you are. The world is the

			one thing, that will not move. It is

			made of stone, round, and very ugly.





IF INTO LOVE THE IMAGE BURDENS


			The front of the head

			is the scarred cranium. The daisy

			night, alone with its mills. Grumbling

			through history, with its nest

			of sorrow. I felt lost

			and alone. The windows

			sat on the street and smoked

			in dangling winter. To autumn

			from spring, summer’s questions

			paths, present to the head

			and fingers. The shelf. The

			rainbow. Cold knuckles rub against

			a window. The rug. The flame. A woman

			kneels against the sill. Each figure

			halves silence. Each equation

			sprinkles light.

			Grey hats and eyes

			for the photographed

			trees. Grey stones and limbs

			and a herd of me’s.

			Past, perfect.

			Each correct color

			not in nature, makes

			us weep. Each inexpressible

			idea. The fog lifts. The fog

			lifts. Now falls. The fog

			falls.

			And nothing is done, or complete. No person

			loved, or made better or beautiful. Came here

			lied to, leave

			the same. Dead boned talk

			of history. Grandfathers skid

			down a ramp of the night. Flame

			for his talk, if it twists

			like light on leaves.

			Out past the fingers.

			Out past the eyes.





BLACK DADA NIHILISMUS


			. Against what light

			is false what breath

			sucked, for deadness.

			Murder, the cleansed

			purpose, frail, against

			God, if they bring him

			bleeding, I would not

			forgive, or even call him

			black dada nihilismus.

			The protestant love, wide windows,

			color blocked to Mondrian, and the

			ugly silent deaths of jews under

			the surgeon’s knife. (To awake on

			69th street with money and a hip

			nose. Black dada nihilismus, for

			the umbrella’d jesus. Trilby intrigue

			blacker art. Thievery (ahh, they return

			those secret gold killers. Inquisitors

			you carry knives? Or brutaled lumps of

			heart? Why you stay, where they can

			reach? Why you sit, or stand, or walk

			in this place, a window on a dark

			straw. New homes, these towers, for those

			lacking money or art. A cult of death,

			need of the simple striking arm under

			the streetlamp. The cutters, from under

			their rented earth. Come up, black dada

			nihilismus. Rape the white girls. Rape

			their fathers. Cut the mothers’ throats.

			Black dada nihilismus, choke my friends

			in their bedrooms with their drinks spilling

A GUERRILLA HANDBOOK


			In the palm

			the seed

			is burned up

			in the wind.

			In their rightness

			the tree trunks are socialists

			leaves murder the silence and are brown

			and old when they blow to the sea.

			Convinced

			of the lyric. Convinced

			of the man’s image (since

			he will not look at substance

			other than his ego. Flowers, grapes

			the shadows of weeds, as the weather

			is colder, and women walk

			with their heads down.

			Silent political rain

			against the speech

			of friends. (We love them

			trapped in life, knowing no way out

			except description. Or black soil

			floating in the arm.

			We must convince the living

			that the dead

			cannot sing.





GREEN LANTERN’S SOLO


			A deep echo, of open fear: the field drawn in

			as if to close, and die, in the old man’s eyes

			as if to shut itself, as the withered mouth of

			righteousness beats its gums on the cooling day.

			As if to die

			without knowing life.

			Having lived, when

			he did ( an old stout God

			in the spent bones

			of his dignity. No screams

			break his wooden lips

			His urine scatters

			as steel, which will fall

			on any soft thing

			you have. ( Murder

			is speaking of us.

			I break and run, or hang back and hide

			having been killed by wild beasts in my young wife’s

			sleep. Having been torn into small echoes of lie, or surrounded

			in dim rooms by the smelly ghosts of wounded intellectuals. Old science majors

			whose mothers were brilliant understudys

			or the famous mistress of a benevolent gangster.

			Some mysterious comment on the world at the birth

			of the word. Some mysterious jangle of intellects bent on the crudeness

			of any death so perfectly ignorant as ours.

			My friend, the lyric poet,

			who has never had an orgasm. My friend,

			the social critic, who has never known society,

			or read the great Italian liars, except his father

			who calls the whitehouse nightly, asking for hideous assignments.

			My friend who has thrown himself against the dignity of all human flesh

			yet beats at its image, as if he was the slow intellect who thought up

			God.

			No, Nigger, no, blind drunk in SantaSurreal’s beard. Dead hero

			for our time who would advance the nation’s economy by poking holes

			in his arms. As golden arms build a forest of loves, and find only

			the heavy belly breath of ladies whispering their false pregnancies through the

			phone. The stagnant image of bats sailing out of their mouths as they

			shape the syllable of revenge. Let me say it is Love, but never feeling.

			It is knowledge, but never perfection, or something as stupidly callous as beauty.

			2

			So important a silence as their lives, dwindled, rusted, corrupted

			away. As the port, where smoke rises for the poor french sailor

			and his indian whore. There are bones, which still clog those blue

			soft seas, and give a human history to nature. Can you understand

			that nothing is free! Even the floating strangeness of the poet’s head

			the crafted visions of the intellect, named, controlled, beat and erected

			to work, and struggle under the heavy fingers of art. What valley, what

			mountain, what eagle or afternoon, is not fixed or changed under our feet

			or eyes? What man unremoved from his meat’s source, can continue

			to believe totally in himself? Or on the littered sidewalks of his personal

			history, can continue to believe in his own dignity or intelligence.

			Except the totally ignorant

			who are our leaders.

			Except the completely devious

			who are our lovers.

			No man except a charlatan

			could be called “Teacher,” as

			big birds will run off from their young

			if they follow too closely, or the drowned youths at puberty

			who did not allow that ritual was stronger than

			their mother’s breasts.

			The completely free are the completely innocent, of which

			no thing I know can claim: despite the dirty feet

			of our wise men, their calm words hung in a line, from city

			to city: despite the sickening courage or useless honesty

			of men who claim to love each other and resolve their lives

			as four letter words: despite the rightness, the strength

			the brilliance and character, the undeniable idiocy of poets

			like Marx and Rousseau.

			What we have created, is ourselves

			as heroes, as lovers, as disgustingly

			evil. As Dialogues with the soul, with

			the self, Selves, screaming furiously

			to each other. As the same fingers

			touch the same faces, as the same

			mouths close on each other. The killed

			is the killer, the loved the lover

			and the islands of mankind have grown huge to include all life,

			all lust, all commerce and beauty. Each idea a reflection of itself

			and all the ideas men have ever had. Truth, Lie, so close they defy

			inspection, and are built into autonomy by naive fools,

			who have no wish for wholeness or strength. Who can not but yearn

			for the One Mind, or Right, or call it some God, a thing beyond

			themselves, some thing toward which all life is fixed, some static,

			irreducible, constantly correcting, dogmatic economy

			of the soul.





WAR POEM


			The battle waxed (battle wax, good night!

			Steep tumors of the sea’s energy

			shells, shells, gold lights under the tree’s

			cover.)

			In spring the days explode

			In spain old cuckolds watch their wives

			and send their money to America.

			Straw roofs, birds, any thing we have not

			got. Destroyed before it got here. Battle,

			an old dead flower she put on her breast.

			Shells crush the beach. Are crushed

			beneath her feet. Wait for night,

			and the one soldier will not mind us

			sitting here, listening to the familiar

			water, scatter in the shadows.





POLITICAL POEM


			for Basil

			Luxury, then, is a way of

			being ignorant, comfortably

			An approach to the open market

			of least information. Where theories

			can thrive, under heavy tarpaulins

			without being cracked by ideas.

			( I have not seen the earth for years

			and think now possibly “dirt” is

			negative, positive, but clearly

			social. I cannot plant a seed, cannot

			recognize the root with clearer dent

			than indifference. Though I eat

			and shit as a natural man ( Getting up

			from the desk to secure a turkey sandwich

			and answer the phone: the poem undone

			undone by my station, by my station,

			and the bad words of Newark.) Raised up

			to the breech, we seek to fill for this

			crumbling century. The darkness of love,

			in whose sweating memory all error is forced.

			Undone by the logic of any specific death. (Old gentlemen

			who still follow fires, tho are quieter

			and less punctual. It is a polite truth

			we are left with. Who are you? What are you

			saying? Something to be dealt with, as easily.

			The noxious game of reason, saying, “No, No,

			you cannot feel,” like my dead lecturer

			lamenting thru gipsies his fast suicide.





SNAKE EYES


			That force is lost

			which shaped me, spent

			in its image, battered, an old brown thing

			swept off the streets

			where it sucked its

			gentle living.

			And what is meat

			to do, that is driven to its end

			by words? The frailest gestures

			grown like skirts around breathing.

			We take

			unholy risks to prove

			we are what we cannot be. For instance,

			I am not even crazy.





A POEM FOR SPECULATIVE HIPSTERS


			He had got, finally,

			to the forest

			of motives. There were no

			owls, or hunters. No Connie Chatterleys

			resting beautifully

			on their backs, having casually

			brought socialism

			to England.

			Only ideas,

			and their opposites.

			Like,

			he was really

			nowhere.





DICHTUNG


			A torn body, correspondent

			of extreme cold. Altitude

			or thought. colliding as an image

			of

			moving water, time, the slip

			of simple life. It is matter, after all,

			that is corrupted, not

			spirit. After all, it is spirit

			that is corrupted

			not matter.

			The role given,

			mashed into protein

			grace. A lifted arm

			in shadow. A lifted thinking

			banging silently

			in the darkness.

			I fondle what

			I find

			of myself. Of you

			what I understand.

			Trumpets of slow weather.

			Love blends

			in season.





VALÉRY AS DICTATOR


			Sad. And it comes

			tomorrow. Again, gray, the streaks

			of work

			shedding the stone

			of the pavement, dissolving

			with the idea

			of singular endeavor. Herds, the

			herds

			of suffering intelligences

			bunched,

			and out of

			hearing. Though the day

			come to us

			in waves,

			sun, air, the beat

			of the clock.

			Though I stare at the radical

			world,

			wishing it would stand still.

			Tell me,

			and I gain at the telling.

			Of the lie, and the waking

			against the heavy breathing

			of new light, dawn, shattering

			the naive cluck

			of feeling

			What is tomorrow

			that it cannot come

			today?





THE LIAR


			What I thought was love

			in me, I find a thousand instances

			as fear. (Of the tree’s shadow

			winding around the chair, a distant music

			of frozen birds rattling

			in the cold.

			Where ever I go to claim

			my flesh, there are entrances

			of spirit. And even its comforts

			are hideous uses I strain

			to understand.

			Though I am a man

			who is loud

			on the birth

			of his ways. Publicly redefining

			each change in my soul, as if I had predicted

			them,

			and profited, biblically, even tho

			their chanting weight,

			erased familiarity

			from my face.

			A question I think,

			an answer, whatever sits

			counting the minutes

			till you die.

			When they say, “It is Roi

			who is dead?” I wonder

			who will they mean?

THREE MODES OF HISTORY AND CULTURE


			Chalk mark sex of the nation, on walls we drummers

			know

			as cathedrals. Cathedra, in a churning meat milk.

			Women glide through looking for telephones. Maps

			weep

			and are mothers and their daughters listening to

			music teachers. From heavy beginnings. Plantations,

			learning

			America, as speech, and a common emptiness. Songs knocking

			inside old women’s faces. Knocking through cardboard trunks.

			Trains

			leaning north, catching hellfire in windows, passing through

			the first ignoble cities of missouri, to illinois, and the panting

			Chicago.

			And then all ways, we go where flesh is cheap. Where factories

			sit open, burning the chiefs. Make your way! Up through fog and

			history

			Make your way, and swing the general, that it come flash open

			and spill the innards of that sweet thing we heard, and gave theory

			to.

			Breech, bridge, and reach, to where all talk is energy. And there’s

			enough, for anything singular. All our lean prophets and rhythms.

			Entire

			we arrive and set up shacks, hole cards, Western hearts at the edge

			of saying. Thriving to balance the meanness of particular skies.

			Race

			of madmen and giants.

			Brick songs. Shoe songs. Chants of open weariness.

			Knife wiggle early evenings of the wet mouth. Tongue

			dance midnight, any season shakes our house. Don’t

			tear my clothes! To doubt the balance of misery

			ripping meat hug shuffle fuck. The Party of Insane

			Hope. I’ve come from there too. Where the dead told lies

			about clever social justice. Burning coffins voted

			and staggered through cold white streets listening

			to Willkie or Wallace or Dewey through the dead face

			of Lincoln. Come from there, and belched it out.

			I think about a time when I will be relaxed.

			When flames and non-specific passion wear themselves

			away. And my eyes and hands and mind can turn

			and soften, and my songs will be softer

			and lightly weight the air.





A POEM WELCOMING JONAS MEKAS

TO AMERICA


			This night’s first star, hung

			high up over a factory. From my window,

			a smile held my poetry in. A tower, where I work

			and drink, vomit, and spoil myself for casual life.

			Looking past things, to their meanings. All the pretensions

			of consciousness. Looking out, or in, the precise stare

			of painful reference. (Saying to the pretty girl, “Pain

			has to be educational.”) Or so I thought, riding down

			in the capsule, call it elevator lady, speedless forceless

			profile thrust toward the modern lamp, in lieu of a natural

			sun. Our beings are here. (Take this chance to lick yourself,

			the salt and stain of memory history and object.) Shit! Love!

			Things we must have some use for. Old niggers in time on the

			dreary street. Man, 50 . . . woman, 50, drunk and falling in the street.

			I could say, looking at their lot, a poet has just made a note of your

			hurt. First star, high over the factory. I could say, if I had any courage

			but my own. First star, high over the factory. Get up off the ground, or

			just look at it, calmly, where you are.





A POEM SOME PEOPLE WILL HAVE

TO UNDERSTAND


			Dull unwashed windows of eyes

			and buildings of industry. What

			industry do I practice? A slick

			colored boy, 12 miles from his

			home. I practice no industry.

			I am no longer a credit

			to my race. I read a little,

			scratch against silence slow spring

			afternoons.

			I had thought, before, some years ago

			that I’d come to the end of my life.

			Watercolor ego. Without the preciseness

			a violent man could propose.

			But the wheel, and the wheels,

			wont let us alone. All the fantasy

			and justice, and dry charcoal winters

			All the pitifully intelligent citizens

			I’ve forced myself to love.

			We have awaited the coming of a natural

			phenomenon. Mystics and romantics, knowledgeable

			workers

			of the land.

			But none has come.

			(Repeat)

			but none has come.

			Will the machinegunners please step forward?





LETTER TO E. FRANKLIN FRAZIER


			Those days when it was all right

			to be a criminal, or die, a postman’s son,

			full of hallways and garbage, behind the hotdog store

			or in the parking lots of the beautiful beer factory.

			Those days I rose through the smoke of chilling Saturdays

			hiding my eyes from the shine boys, my mouth and my flesh

			from their sisters. I walked quickly and always alone

			watching the cheap city like I thought it would swell

			and explode, and only my crooked breath could put it together again.

			By the projects and small banks of my time. Counting my steps

			on tar or new pavement, following the sun like a park. I imagined

			a life, that was realer than speech, or the city’s anonymous

			fish markets. Shuddering at dusk, with a mile or so up the hill

			to get home, who did you love

			then, Mussolini? What were you thinking,

			Lady Day? A literal riddle of image

			was me, and my smell was a continent

			of familiar poetry. Walking the long way,

			always the long way, and up the steep hill.

			Those days like one drawn-out song, monotonously

			promising. The quick step, the watchful march march,

			All were leading here, to this room, where memory

			stifles the present. And the future, my man, is long

			time gone.





THE PEOPLE BURNING


			May-Day! May-Day!

			—Pilot talk

			They now gonna make us shut up. Ease

			thru windows in eight dollar hats

			sharpening their pencils on match books. List

			our errors and lies, stumbling over our souls

			in the dark, for the sake of unnatural advantage.

			They now gonna line you up, ask you about God. Nail

			your answers on the wall, for the bowling alley owners

			to decide. They now gonna pretend they flowers. Snake stalked

			large named vegetables, who have, if nothing else,

			the title: World’s Vilest Living Things.

			The Dusty Hearts of Texas, whose most honest world

			is the long look into darkness, sensing the glittering

			affront of reason or faith or learning. Preferring

			fake tiger smells rubbed on the balls, and clothes

			the peasants of no country on earth would ever be

			vulgar enough to wear. The legacy of diseased mediocrity.

			Become an Italian or Jew. Forget the hatred of natural

			insolence. The teetering sense of right, as balance, each

			natural man must have. Become a Jew, and join the union,

			forget about Russia or any radicalism past a hooked grin.

			Become an Italian quietist in some thin veneer of reasonable

			gain. Lodi, Metuchen, Valley Stream, welcomes you into its

			leather ridiculousness. Forget about any anarchy except the

			understandable urge to be violent, or flashy, or fast, or

			heavy fisted. Sing at Radio City, but never rage at the chosen,

			for they have given you the keys to their hearts. Made you

			the Fridays and Saturdays of the regime, clothed you in promise

			and utility, and banned your thinkers to worship the rags

			of your decline.

			For the Reconstruction, for the march into any anonymous America,

			stretches beyond hills of newsprint, and dishonorable intention.

			Forget any dignity, but that that is easily purchased. And recognized

			by Episcopalians as they pay their garbage bills. The blueprint’s sound.

			And the nation is smaller and the loudest mouths are recognized

			and stunned by the filth of their hopeless truths. (I’ve got to

			figure this all out. Got to remember just where I came in. Freedom Suite,

			some five six years ago, Rollins cradling the sun, as it rose, and we

			dreamed then, of becoming, unlike our fathers, and the other cowboys,

			strong men in our time, raging and clawing, at fools of any persuasion.)

			Now they ask me to be a jew or italian, and turn from the moment

			disappearing into the shaking clock of treasonable safety, like reruns

			of films, with sacred coon stars. To retreat, and replay; throw my mind out,

			sit down and brood about the anachronistic God, they will tell you

			is real. Sit down and forget it. Lean on your silence, breathing

			the dark. Forget your whole life, pop your fingers in a closed room,

			hopped-up witch doctor for the cowards of a recent generation. It is

			choice, now, like a philosophy problem. It is choice, now, and

			the weight is specific and personal. It is not an emotional decision.

			There are facts, and who was it said, that this is a scientific century.





DEATH IS NOT AS NATURAL

AS YOU FAGS SEEM TO THINK


			I hunt

			the black puritan.

			(Half-screamer

			in dull tones

			of another forest.

			Respecter of power. That it transform, and enlarge

			Hierarchy crawls over earth (change exalting space

			Dried mud to mountain, cape and whip, swirled

			Walkers, and riders and flyers.

			Language spread into darkness. Be Vowel

			and value

			Consonant

			and direction.

			Rather the lust of the thing

			than across to droop at its energies. In melted snows

			the leather cracks, and pure men claw at their bodies.

			Women laugh delicately, delicately rubbing their thighs.

			And the dead king laughs, looking out the hole

			in his tomb. Seeing the poor

			singing his evil songs.





THE SUCCESS


			Among things with souls, find me.

			Picking thru the alphabet

			or leaning out the window. (Lives

			and magic.) Old witch city, the

			lights and roads (floating) up near the tops

			of buildings. Electric names, which are not

			love’s. A rolling Eastern distress. Water cutting

			the coast, lulling the mysterious classes.

			Murderers humming under the window.

			A strutting long headed Negro. Beneath the red silk

			of unique social fantasy. Shore invisible under tenements.

			The Jew who torments Hitler in Paradise, wiping thick fingers

			on a hospital cloth. His fingerprints on the dough, marking it

			before baking. Drifting to sleep in Pelham, fucking a female spy.

			This man was used against me,

			in a dream.

			Broken teeth

			Dirty apron

			Hires a bowery desperado,

			to pull out the garbage

			and imagine the whiteness

			of his wife’s withered stomach.

			—

			Ding

			—

			The proportion of Magic

			has seeped so low.

			For the 1st person plural

			America, then,

			Atlantis,

			in blind overdose.





THE NEW WORLD


			The sun is folding, cars stall and rise

			beyond the window. The workmen leave

			the street to the bums and painters’ wives

			pushing their babies home. Those who realize

			how fitful and indecent consciousness is

			stare solemnly out on the emptying street.

			The mourners and soft singers. The liars,

			and seekers after ridiculous righteousness. All

			my doubles, and friends, whose mistakes cannot

			be duplicated by machines, and this is all of our

			arrogance. Being broke or broken, dribbling

			at the eyes. Wasted lyricists, and men

			who have seen their dreams come true, only seconds

			after they knew those dreams to be horrible conceits

			and plastic fantasies of gesture and extension,

			shoulders, hair and tongues distributing misinformation

			about the nature of understanding. No one is that simple

			or priggish, to be alone out of spite and grown strong

			in its practice, mystics in two-pants suits. Our style,

			and discipline, controlling the method of knowledge.

			Beatniks, like Bohemians, go calmly out of style. And boys

			are dying in Mexico, who did not get the word.

			The lateness of their fabrication: mark their holes

			with filthy needles. The lust of the world. This will not

			be news. The simple damning lust,

			float flat magic in low changing

			evenings. Shiver your hands

			in dance. Empty all of me for

			knowing, and will the danger

			of identification,

			Let me sit and go blind in my dreaming

			and be that dream in purpose and device.

			A fantasy of defeat, a strong strong man

			older, but no wiser than the defect of love.





THE BURNING GENERAL


			Smoke seeping from my veins. Loss from

			the eyes. Seeing winter throw its wind

			around. Hoping for more, than I’ll ever

			have. Forgetting my projects, and the projected

			sense of order, any claim to “sense” must make.

			The reason Allen and the others (even freakish

			pseudo dada mama) in the money jungle of controlled

			pederasty

			finally bolted. Shut and gone, at the same time.

			But can we replace the common exchange of experience with stroking

			some skinny girl’s penis? Is sense to be lost, all of it, so that

			we can walk up Mulberry Street without getting beat up in Italian.

			Violence and repression. Silly Nigger hatred for the

			silk band of misery. They are right, those farty doctors. Perhaps

			it is best to ease into kill-heaven than have no heaven at all.

			What do you think, Eddie, out there in Idaho shivering against

			the silence, the emptiness of straight up America? What’s it look like

			there?

			Can we ask a man to savor the food of oppression? Even

			if it’s rich and full of mysterious meaning. Can you establish

			(and that word must give my whole game away) any kind of equality?

			Can there be such thing forced on the world? That is, that the poor

			and their owners appreciate light wherever they are, simply as light.

			Why are you so sophisticated? You used to piss and shit in your pants.

			Now you walk around thinking all the time, as if that sacred act

			would rewrite the world in bop talk, giving medals to every limping coon

			in creation.

			Is there more to it than that? This is the time to ask, even while perfecting

			your line. We realize that ends and means should be separated, but who

			will do the separating? The evaluating. You want your experience

			thought of as valuable. Which is, listen baby, only another kind

			of journalistic enterprise. Not worthy of that bumpy madness

			crawled up your thighs when the urine dried those sweet lost winters,

			and tears were the whole fucking world.





TONE POEM


			for Elvin Jones and Bob Thompson

			A host of loves is the city, and its memory

			dead sense traveling (from England) on the sea

			for two hundred years. The travelers show up in Japan

			to promote peace and prosperity, perhaps a piece

			of that nation’s ass. Years later, years later,

			plays rework the rime of lust. As history, and a cloud

			their faces bang invisible notes, wind scribbled leaves

			and foam. An eagle hangs above them spinning. Years and travelers

			linger among the dead, no reports, gunshots white puffs

			deciding the season and the mode of compromise. The general good

			has no troops or armor, subtly the books stand closed, except

			sad facts circled for unknown hippies carrying the mail.

			I leave it there, for them, full of hope, and hurt. All the poems

			are full of it. Shit and hope, and history. Read this line

			young colored or white and know I felt the twist of dividing

			memory. Blood spoiled in the air, caked and anonymous. Arms opening,

			opened last night, we sat up howling and kissing. Men who loved

			each other. Will that be understood? That we could, and still

			move under cold nights with clenched fists. Swing these losers

			by the tail. Got drunk then high, then sick, then quiet. But thinking

			(and of you lovely shorties sit in libraries seeking such ideas out).

			I’m here now, LeRoi, who tried to say something long for you. Keep it.

			Forget me, or what I say, but not the tone, and exit image. No points,

			or theories, from now on, just me and mine, when they get me, just

			think of me as typing with a drink at my right hand, some women who

			love me . . . and the day growing old and sloppy through the window.





GATSBY’S THEORY OF AESTHETICS


			Verse, as a form, is artificial. Poetry is not a form, but rather a result. Whatever the matter, its meaning, if precise enough in its information (and direction) of the world, is poetic. The poetic is the value of poetry, and any concatenation of elements is sufficient to induce the poetic. What you see is as valuable as what you do not. But it is not as meaningful (to you). Poetry aims at difficult meanings. Meanings not already catered to. Poetry aims at reviving, say, a sense of meaning, or meaning’s possibility and ubiquitousness.

			Identification can be one term of that possibility. That is, showing a thing with its meaning apparent through the act of that showing. Interpretation can be another term. That is, supporting a meaning, with one’s own life. That is, under, standing. And using that position as a map, or dictionary. Depending on whether you move or sit.

			I write poetry only to enlist the poetic consistently as apt description of my life. I write poetry only in order to feel, and that, finally, sensually, all the terms of my life. I write poetry to investigate my self, and my meaning and meanings.

			But also to invest the world with a clearer understanding of it self, but only by virtue of my having brought some clearer understanding of my self into it. I wrote in a poem once, “Feeling predicts intelligence.”

			But it is possible to feel with any part of our consciousness. Whatever part of us does register: whatever. The head feels. The heart feels. The penis feels. The penis is also, because it is able to feel, conscious, and has intelligence of its own. No one can deny that intelligence, or at least no one should try. The point of life is that it is arbitrary, except in its basest forms. Arbitrariness, or self imposed meaning, is the only thing worth living for. It is the only thing that permits us to live.

			The only time I am conscious of my limitations is when I am writing. The rest of the time, there is no standard, at all reasonable, for judging, in fact, what limitations are.

ALL’S WELL


			for E.R. &MB.

			African in the Bush of the Hatreds. One gone.

			An old time love withered, in seeing, off and on

			in a thing like rain (the wetness in your head, and

			all the stampeding, fear, hacked open skulls grinning

			sensing your loss, the words floating just beyond your

			fingers (invisible antennae

			Just drew a blank, dope nod

			corrupting what’s left, and that nothing

			confusion of blankness, the hatred when I wake

			silence for motives, she, woman I am with, is

			silent, as the dream of some other woman, never

			existed, tho she be of flesh and red sperm spinning

			through her veins. This woman came when I stuck her

			iron insect screams holes. Blood flew up into the

			dropper, we sent it back in her. Eyes rolled up,

			lap quivered, lip shook. The next time she

			got depressed going cross town. She held me so.

			Not understanding the buildings stopped, and sky

			hung above them just the same





THE BRONZE BUCKAROO


			for Herb Jeffries

			Soft night comes back

			with its clangs and dreams. Back

			in through the base

			of the hairy skull. The heavy pictures, unavailable

			solaces, emptying their churchy magic

			out. Golden girls, and thin black ones

			patrol the dreamer’s meat. Things

			shovel themselves, from where they always are. Spinning, a

			moment’s indecision, past the vision of stealth and silence

			Byron thought the night could be. Death blow Eliot silence, dwindling

			away, in the 20th century. Poet clocks crouched in their Americas.

			Dreaming of poems, only the cold sky could bring. Not room poems, or

			fireplace poems, or the great washed poetry of our dizzy middleclass.

			But something creeps and grabs them, rapes them on the pavement. The Screams

			are not essays, rich blonde poetess from the mysteries of Kipling’s harmon

			nica! Not guileful treatises of waste and desire, stuck somewhere

			nursing her tilted beauty, like some old fashion whore, embarrassed

			by God, or his diseases. The funny heart blows smoke, in the winter

			and gives us all the earth we need. In summer, it sweats, and remembers.

			Half way up the hill the mutineers stand, and seek their comrades out.

			I am half way up, and standing.





NUMBERS, LETTERS


			If you’re not home, where

			are you? Where’d you go? What

			were you doing when gone? When

			you come back, better make it good.

			What was you doing down there, freakin’ off

			with white women, hangin’ out

			with Queens, say it straight to be

			understood straight, put it flat and real

			in the street where the sun comes and the

			moon comes and the cold wind in winter

			waters your eyes. Say what you mean, dig

			it out put it down, and be strong

			about it.

			I cant say who I am

			unless you agree I’m real

			I cant be anything I’m not

			Except these words pretend

			to life not yet explained,

			so here’s some feeling for you

			see how you like it, what it

			reveals, and that’s Me.

			Unless you agree I’m real

			that I can feel

			whatever beats hardest

			at our black souls

			I am real, and I can’t say who

			I am. Ask me if I know, I’ll say

			yes, I might say no. Still, ask.

			I’m Everett LeRoi Jones, 30 yrs old.

			A black nigger in the universe. A long breath singer,

			wouldbe dancer, strong from years of fantasy

			and study. All this time then, for what’s happening

			now. All that spilling of white ether, clocks in ghostheads

			lips drying and rewet, eyes opening and shut, mouths churning.

			I am a meditative man, And when I say something it’s all of me

			saying, and all the things that make me, have formed me, colored me

			this brilliant reddish night. I will say nothing that I feel is

			lie, or unproven by the same ghostclocks, by the same riders

			always move so fast with the word slung over their backs or

			in saddlebags, charging down Chinese roads. I carry some words,

			some feeling, some life in me. My heart is large as my mind

			this is a messenger calling, over here, over here, open your eyes

			and your ears and your souls; today is the history we must learn

			to desire. There is no guilt in love.





RED EYE


			for Calvin Hernton and Ishmael Reed

			The corrupt madness of the individual. You cannot live

			alone. You are in the world. World, fuck them. World rise

			and twist like you do, night madness in rain as heavy as stones.

			Alabama gypsy talk, for peeling lips. Look in your mother’s head,

			if you really want to know everything. Your sister’s locked up

			pussy. Invasion of the idea syndrome like hand clapping winter in.

			Winter will make you move. Or you will freeze in Russia and

			never live to see Napoleon as conceived by Marlon Brando.

			We are at the point where death is too good for us. We are

			in love with the virtue of evil. This communication. Rapping

			on wet meat windows, they spin in your head, if I kill you

			will not even have chance to hate me





A WESTERN LADY


			The sick tightening. Brain damage movie

			of forbidden flesh, laying in the shadows

			breathing without purpose, meat stacked

			in terrible silence, her mother wept

			to think of that meat, her father, paced

			and said the star spangled banner into

			his brain damage soup. These were windows

			we looked through. The brother died in a

			guitar school, stringing guitars and praying

			for a piece. And it was his own movie star

			slipping green panties over high heels. Hence

			his pimples, and the bunching of his waistband.

			No one is expected to be rich and smart. Hence

			planes go down from 30,000, full of screaming

			materialists, whose mothers stunted them

			hanging around election machines. It was the metal clack

			that did it. A flag lobotomy, which has the victims

			wallowing on warehouse floors, whistling popular Bach.

			I suffer with these announcers. Butter and egg men,

			whose promise rolled with the big ice, them’s pre-

			historic times.





RETURN OF THE NATIVE


			Harlem is vicious

			modernism. BangClash.

			Vicious the way its made.

			Can you stand such beauty?

			So violent and transforming.

			The trees blink naked, being

			so few. The women stare

			and are in love with them

			selves. The sky sits awake

			over us. Screaming

			at us. No rain.

			Sun, hot cleaning sun

			drives us under it.

			The place, and place

			meant of

			black people. Their heavy Egypt.

			(Weird word!) Their minds, mine,

			the black hope mine. In Time.

			We slide along in pain or too

			happy. So much love

			for us. All over, so much of

			what we need. Can you sing

			yourself, your life, your place

			on the warm planet earth.

			And look at the stones

			the hearts, the gentle hum

			of meaning. Each thing, life

			we have, or love, is meant

			for us in a world like this.

			Where we may see ourselves

			all the time. And suffer

			in joy, that our lives

			are so familiar.





BLACK ART

			between ’lizabeth taylor’s toes. Stinking

			Whores! We want “poems that kill.”

			Assassin poems, Poems that shoot

			guns. Poems that wrestle cops into alleys

			Let the world be a Black Poem

POEM FOR HALFWHITE COLLEGE STUDENTS


			Who are you, listening to me, who are you

			listening to yourself? Are you white or

			black or does that have anything to do

			with it? Can you pop your fingers to no

			music, except those wild monkies go on

			in your head, can you jerk, to no melody,

			except finger poppers get it together

			when you turn from starchecking to checking

			yourself. How do you sound, your words, are they

			yours? The ghost you see in the mirror, is it really

			you, can you swear you are not an imitation greyboy,

			can you look right next to you in that chair, and swear,

			that the sister you have your hand on is not really

			so full of Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton is

			coming out of her ears. You may even have to be Richard

			with a white shirt and face, and four million negroes

			think you cute, you may have to be Elizabeth Taylor, old lady,

			if you want to sit up in your crazy spot dreaming about dresses,

			and the sway of certain porters’ hips. Check yourself, learn who it is

			speaking, when you make some ultrasophisticated point, check yourself,

			when you find yourself gesturing like Steve McQueen, check it out, ask

			in your black heart who it is you are, and is that image black or white,

			you might be surprised right out the window, whistling dixie on the way in.

ARE THEIR BLUES SINGERS IN RUSSIA?


			Spies are found wanting. They wanted

			in line, on the snow, a love to get high

			with, and not, the line, a lie, a circling

			tone of merciless involvement, the pushing, the

			stomping, an image of green space was what the spy

			wanted, standing there being shoved and hurled around

			by his nostrils. They cold nights, after waiting, and

			worse mornings. When the girls go by, and the lights go off

			and on, to forget the clocks, and the counting of cobblestones

			to keep pure cellar static off his back. The li’l darling, holding

			’is wee wee he gotta pee, a little run down he leg. He pants soiled,

			the wind freezed that part of his leg that wanted love most

			We stand for tragic emblems when we return to the pros and cons

			of the world. The shielding, for nothing. God’s contradictions we

			speak about as if we knew something, or could feel past what we

			describe, and enter the new forms of being. See the door and enter,

			get in out of the snow, the watermoccasins, and stuff, mud he

			carried around in his mouth, or on the ground up to his ankles,

			it’ll get stupid or boring. So much, so much, to prepare a proper

			place, to not exist in.

			The day was a bargain.

			A jew on the corner was thinking

			of bargains. A dog, out back

			did not start yet, howling, puny words,

			barking in sorrow, a boat, for the spy’s family to ride in

			while they watched a sinking image of the world, and the spy’s death

			in snow they could really dig as beautiful or cool or somewhere else,

			or just grimy lace curtains would make them hang against the boat’s window

			dreaming of God. The disappointment would come

			after they opened their mouths, or version last

			would come, and coparmies would salute the jewish dog

			barking the rhythms of embezzled deserts.

			We are all spies for god.

			We can get betrayed. We ask for it, we ask

			so much. And expect the fire the sun set the horizon

			to slide through human speech dancing our future dimensions.

			We expect some real shit. We expect to love all the things

			somebody runs down to us. We want things, and are locked here, to the earth,

			by pussy chains, or money chains, or personal indulgence chains, lies, weak

			phone calls, attempts to fly when we know good and fucking well we can’t and even

			the nerve to get mad, and walk around pretending we are huge magnets for the

			most beautiful force in the universe. And we are, but not in the image of wind

			spreading the grass, or brown grass dying from a sudden snow, near the unemploy-

			ment office where the spy stands trying to remember just why he wanted to

			be the kinda spy he was

DAS KAPITAL


			Strangling women in the suburban bush

			they bodies laid around rotting while martinis are drunk

			the commuters looking for their new yorkers feel a draft

			& can get even drunker watching the teevee later on the Ford

			replay. There will be streams of them coming, getting off

			near where the girls got killed. Two of them strangled by

			the maniac.

			There are maniacs hidden everywhere cant you see? By the dozens

			and double dozens, maniacs by the carload (tho they are

			a minority). But they terrorize us uniformly, all over the place

			we look at the walls of our houses, the garbage cans parked full

			strewn around our defaulting cities, and we cd get scared. A rat

			eases past us on his way to a banquet, can you hear the cheers raised

			through the walls, full of rat humor. Blasts of fire, some woman’s son will stumble

			and dies with a pool of blood around his head. But it wont be the maniac. These old houses

			crumble, the unemployed stumble by us straining, ashy fingered, harassed. The air is cold

			winter heaps above us consolidating itself in degrees. We need a aspirin or something, and

			pull our jackets close. The baldhead man on the television set goes on in a wooden way

			his unappetizing ignorance can not be stood, or understood. The people turn the channel

			looking for Good Times and get a negro with a pulldown hat. Flashes of maniac shadows before

			bed, before you pull down the shade you can see the leaves being blown down the street

			too dark now to see the writing on them, the dates, and amounts we owe. The streets too

			will soon be empty, after the church goers go on home having been saved again from the

			Maniac . . . except a closeup of the chief mystic’s face rolling down to his hands will send

			shivers through you, looking for traces of the maniacs life. Even there among the mythophrenics.

			What can you do? It’s time finally to go to bed. The shadows close around and the room is still.

			Most of us know there’s a maniac loose. Our lives a jumble of frustrations and unfilled

			capacities. The dead girls, the rats noise, the flashing somber lights, the dead voice on

			television, was that blood and hair beneath the preacher’s fingernails? A few other clues

			we mull them over as we go to sleep, the skeletons of dollarbills, traces of dead used up

			labor, lead away from the death scene until we remember a quiet fit that everywhere

			is the death scene. Tomorrow you got to hit it sighs through us like the wind, we got to

			hit it, like an old song at radio city, working for the yanqui dollarrrr, when we were

			children, and then we used to think it was not the wind, but the maniac scratching against

			our windows. Who is the maniac, and why everywhere at the same time . . .

			he and pat have been snorting since

			early morning, herb alpert blurting low contradictions in the wings

			Shadows gather on the windows, then blow twisted into the whole dark

			in the white house. Ford cracking his knuckles

			turns off the tv and calls nixon

			you alright dick, he says, white whistles jag at nixons calm, high

			and wild, pat’s jaws quivering, green and blues come off the screen

			ford says the plan, was national

			unity, the new money

			and the old,

			he cant speak, nixon cant, high, and hot, cripple forever upstairs

			pat starts to pee on the rug, and roll in it. Her giggles like a vincent

			price movie, without popcorn, nixon slobbers, trying to make a point, ford

			is saying national unity, as rockefeller grins, his finger, shoving up into

			the air, across a thousand miles, at the mad western capitalists and their

			southern friends. Yall dont know how, this shit works, he is saying (really)

			the commentator, looks over his shoulder, as if he knows that nixon is

			watching. Ford whispers numbly, dick, dick, yes,

A NEW REALITY IS BETTER

THAN A NEW MOVIE!


			How will it go, crumbling earthquake, towering inferno, juggernaut, volcano, smashup, in reality, other than the feverish nearreal fantasy of the capitalist flunky film hacks tho they sense its reality breathing a quake inferno scar on their throat even snorts of 100% pure cocaine cant cancel the cold cut of impending death to this society. On all the screens of america, the joint blows up every hour and a half for two dollars an fifty cents. They have taken the niggers out to lunch, for a minute, made us partners nigger Charlie) or surrogates (boss nigger) for their horror. But just as superafrikan mobutu cannot leopardskinhat his way out of responsibility for lumumba’s death, nor even with his incredible billions rockefeller cannot even save his pale ho’s titties in the crushing weight of things as they really are. How will it go, does it reach you, getting up, sitting on the side of the bed, getting ready to go to work. Hypnotized by the machine, and the cement floor, the jungle treachery of trying to survive with no money in a money world, of making the boss 100,000 for every 200 dollars you get, and then having his brother get you for the rent, and if you want to buy the car you helped build, your downpayment paid for it, the rest goes to buy his old lady a foam rubber rhinestone set of boobies for special occasions when kissinger drunkenly fumbles with her blouse, forgetting himself.

			If you don’t like it, what you gonna do about it. That was the question we asked each other, & still right regularly need to ask. You don’t like it? Whatcha gonna do, about it?? The real terror of nature is humanity enraged, the true technicolor spectacle that hollywood cant record. They cant even show you how you look when you go to work, or when you come back. They cant even show you thinking or demanding the new socialist reality, its the ultimate tidal wave. When all over the planet, men and women, with heat in their hands, demand that society be planned to include the lives and self determination of all the people ever to live. That is the scalding scenario with a cast of just under two billion that they dare not even whisper. Its called, “We Want It All . . .

			The Whole World!”





A POEM FOR DEEP THINKERS


			Skymen coming down out the clouds land

			and then walking into society try to find out

			whats happening—“Whats happening,” they be saying

			look at it, where they been, dabbling in mist, appearing &

			disappearing, now there’s a real world breathing—inhaling

			exhaling concrete & sand, and they want to know what’s

			happening. What’s happening is life itself “onward & upward,”

			the spirals of fireconflict clash of opposing forces, the dialogue of

			yes and no, showed itself in stabbed children in the hallways of

			schools, old men strangling bankguards, a hard puertorican inmate’s tears

			exchanging goodbyes in the prison doorway, armies sweeping

			wave after wave to contest the ancient rule of the minority. What

			draws them down, their blood entangled with humans,

			their memories, perhaps, of the earth, and what they thought it

			could be. But blinded by sun, and their own images of things,

			rather than things as they actually are, they wobble, they

			stumble, sometimes, and people they be cheering alot, cause

			they think the skymen dancing, “Yeh . . . Yeh . . . get on

			it. . . . ,” people grinning and feeling good cause the skymen

			dancing, and the skymen stumbling, till they get the sun out

			they eyes, and integrate the inhead movie show, with the

			material reality that exists with and without them. There are

			tragedies, tho, a buncha skies bought the loopdieloop program

			from the elegant babble of the ancient minorities. Which is

			where they loopdieloop in the sky right on just loopdieloop

			in fantastic meaningless curlicues which delight the thin gallery

			owners who wave at them on their way to getting stabbed in the

			front seats of their silver alfa romeos by lumpen they have gotten

			passionate with. And the loopdieloopers go on, sometimes

			spelling out complex primitive slogans and shooting symbolic

			smoke out their gills in honor of something dead. And then they’ll make daring dives right down toward the

			earth and skag cocaine money whiteout and crunch iced into the statue graveyard where Ralph

			Ellison sits biting his banjo

			strings retightening his instrument for the millionth time before

			playing the star spangled banjo. Or else loopdieloop loopdieloop

			up higher and higher and thinner and thinner and finer

			refiner, sugarladdies in the last days of the locust, sucking they greek lolliepops.

			Such intellectuals as we is baby, we need to deal in the real

			world, and be be in the real world. We need to use, to use, all

			the all the skills all the spills and thrills that we conjure, that we

			construct, that we lay out and put together, to create life as

			beautiful as we thought it could be, as we dreamed it could be,

			as we desired it to be, as we knew it could be, before we took

			off, before we split for the sky side, not to settle for endless

			meaningless circles of celebration of this madness, this madness,

			not to settle for this madness this madness madness, these yoyos

			yoyos of the ancient minorities. Its all for real, everythings for

			real, be for real, song of the skytribe walking the earth, faint

			smiles to open roars of joy, meet you on the battlefield they say,

			they be humming, hop, then stride, faint smile to roars of open

			joy, hey my man, what’s happening, meet you on the

			battlefield

			they say, meet you on the battlefield they say, what i guess needs to be discussed here tonight

			is what side yall gon be on

PRES SPOKE IN A LANGUAGE


			Pres

			spoke in a language

			“of his own.” What did he say, between the

			horn line

			s, pork pie hat

			tenor tilted

			pres once was a drummer but gave it up cause other dudes was getting

			the foxes

			while he packed his tomtoms

			“Ding Dong,” pres sd, meaning

			like a typewriter, its the end

			of this

			line. “No Eyes,” pres wd say, meaning

			I didn’t cdn’t dig it, and what it was was

			lame. Pres

			had a language

			and a life, like,

			all his own,

			but in the teeming whole of us he lived

			toooting on his sideways horn

			translating frankie trumbauer into

			Bird’s feathers

			Tranes sinewy tracks

			the slickster walking through the crowd

			surviving on a terrifying wit

			its the jungle the jungle the jungle

			we living in

			and cats like pres cd make it because they were clear they, at least,

			had to,

			to do anything else.

			Save all that comrades, we need it.

			HUMANITY IS METAPHYSICAL

			To under stand that . . .

			can you? I mean really

			really dig what that means . . . It’s like monsters roaming the

			earth . . . who sting to live, who know no better. Who, like wild animals, might sing, or make a sound some way, that might pretend, imitate, a human cry, the sweet rationality of love.

			That is the art of it, that it exists and carries with it, so many complexities, even that craziness, but then aesthetics is connected to the real. The deadliness of that

			ugliness, or uncomprehended smoothness. The technology of predatory creatures who feed on flesh, who shit on the tender aspirations of human evolution, because they have no conception of humanity. Except as that natural yelp, which they can see as somehow, a reflex of what that might be. It took that kind of vision for them to understand the use of religion in the changing world. To cloak themselves in the modest trappings of early christianity, having murdered its prophet for power and profit.

			That star, just over the grey green peak (the moonlight

			acknowledges us and makes us shadows.) Was how I was led,

			A slender black woman, around 23, put out her hand, turning

			toward the star. You know how night is, the star was blue and

			beautiful. Around it music, we drummed through the forests.

			Their ignorance, that country of “Their” and its united snakes

			unified in madness, and worship of advantage. You cannot

			have aristocracy, except you have slaves.

			Yet our going, our breathing, the substance

			This was always, and remains

			There is some music, that shd come on now.

			The Tories

			& Malcolm X

			Have all been

			betrayed

			All revolutions bear their own

			betrayal, & betrayers

			The world is complex

			its reality materially

			simple

			It is the dying of the life

			the quenching of the spark

			the greying of the light

			the cold whiteness of the recently

			full of flaming inspired intelligent

			heart! The dead entrail of our

			collective traditional

			enemy. Animal

			connections. Metaphysics.

			Greed. Anti Science

			lives. Ugly in power

			and uglying up our only

			life.

			The rot, the lie, the opposite

			will always, if there is ever

			that, exist. As life means death

			and hot cold. Darkness lights’

			closest companion. Its twisted,

			& rises as a spiral. It is No &

			Yes, and not It for long.

			Motion, the beat, tender mind

			you humans even made music.

			But, our memory anywhere

			as humans and beyond, parallel

			to everything, is rise is new is

			Changed, a glowing peaceful

			Musical

			World.

			What betrays revolution is the need

			for revolution. It can not stop in life.

			Whoever seeks to freeze the moment is

			instantly, & for that instant, mad!

			We are servants of life in upward

			progressive motion. Fanners

			of the flame. Resistance is Electric.

			Fred sd, its measurable on every

			block.

			The wd be stoppers of revolution

			are its fossil fuel

			We talked all the time

			as spirits we were

			allowed.

			& watched the different

			primates in their turns

			& elegant twists

			We caught the rising virus

			like a style of neon

			murders. A calm

			blood washing upward

			Between giggles & drunk laughter

			wisdom hit the walls

			& ceiling, windows

			closed if open

			opened if

			closed

			It was never quiet

			no familiarities

			were permitted

			The good guys sat

			& watched the door

			the wizards crawled

			from 14th St to the

			outer crust

			Colors & rain

			The well dressed well spoken

			The poverty stricken

			The lonely

			The important

			maniacs

			They were singing through their

			noses, & fingers

			Everybody was a headline

			A massacre that cd not

			be a revelated gorilla

			These were rich people & Heroes

			The stink was not stink, the garbage

			not really garbage. If you cd bend concrete

			& hang like the high tent of drunken rapists

			Applause wd rock & roll you in yr dreams

			Awards could be coughs

			hands reaching

			poetry of climaxes

			proposed. Crippled

			Weasels I knew

			& sang a song

			for the airplane

			Not to be subjective

			a heart full of dashes

Y THE LINK WILL NOT ALWAYS BE “MISSING” #40


			The Wise One

			Trane

			Think of Slavery

			as

			Educational!

			FUNK LORE

			1995





J. SAID, “OUR WHOLE UNIVERSE IS GENERATED BY A RHYTHM”


			Is Dualism, the shadow inserted

			for the northern trip. as the northern

			trip. minstrels of the farther land,

			the sun, in one place, ourselves, somewhere

			else. The Universe

			is the rhythm

			there is no on looker, no outside

			no other than the real, the universe

			is rhythm, and whatever is only is as

			swinging. All that is is funky, the bubbles

			in the monsters brain, are hitting it too,

			but the circles look like

			swastikas, the square is thus

			explained, but the nazis had dances, and even some of the

			victims would tell you that.

			There is no such thing as “our

			universe”, only degrees of the swinging, what

			does not swing is nothing, and nothing swings

			when it wants to. The desire alone is funky

			and it is this heat Louis Armstrong scatted in.

			What is not funky is psychological, metaphysical

			is the religion of squares, pretending no one

			is anywhere.

			Everything gets hot, it is hot now, nothing cold exists

			and cold, is the theoretical line the pretended boundary

			where your eye and your hand disappear into desire.

			Dualism is a quiet camp near the outer edge of the forest.

			there the inmates worship money and violence. They are

			learning right now to sing, let us join them for a moment

			and listen. Do not laugh, whatever you do.

SOUNDING


			A Measure, A Song, A Curse

			And so the seasons, they tell us

			are more important, than ourselves

			flies and starlight, all the little

			things. Except ourselves. Should you

			want one, a self, any way. Detached

			from the Death pile of this, the primitive

			distortion, still. Prehistoric monsters

			cave logic, uncooked stumblings, witchdoctoristic

			shit.	If you had a self

			If you was up under all that pile

			If you could still breathe or see

			beneath the assault of ancient deadly lies

			kept alive by the infinite sucking needles

			of rich white craziness, of schizophrenic negro

			craziness, the chauvinism of savages, disease

			for sale, famous rotting items to be eaten or

			smeared in the nose and ears, corpse parts

			to paste on the eyes, vomit music, which is

			quiet and stinks and full of vague balls

			flags made of twilight to wrap around anything

			sensitive until it smothers.

			(Head smashed through a door

			splinters jabbed in the neck

			blood is the number to ask for

			blind visionaries babbling)

			They say everything is more important than a self. The whole group of them. Stashed somewhere between the stars blinking and blue, someone intelligent might find us, very very intelligent. Wizards rattling gourds as your leg is about to drop off. A Muslim appears, A Talmudist, A Christian, A Capitalist economist, the rattling gets stronger and the leg finally drops off gangrenous tootsie roll

			No selves, only “eats” and “drinks” and drugs and “fucking”. No selves. What about only alone, there is no one else, its OK then, no one can tell. A tree felled in the forest, there’s no sound in New York. It doesnt exist then, in Omaha or Heaven. No selves, not together, thinking. Not alive and actually planning in the world to change it. Not no science, no. No selves then, collected, and eyes blinking. None of that. A coffin, lets kill ourselves. Lets get a bomb a big explosive mushroom volcano and drop it on ourselves. No selves, lets blow up everything. Lets blow up men and women and children and thought and feeling. Lets make it flat and burned. Lets be radioactive and write poems about paths in connecticut. About birdbaths in vermont and wisps of smoke in south hampton. no selves, not even one, except alone. an individual is OK, only alone. not with touching and seeing in it. not with no intimate whispering. Keep bullshit like love out of it. none of that. no selves. only 12 hr barbaric killing of niggers and white ass working class motherfuckers with hard hands.

			Bees darting. A cloud. Light dancing. Twiddle dee and tweedle doo and silent bumps. no being and stuff. no wanting except gold vinyl spots. you can want gold vinyl spots. No being more, only being less except you can be more if that is less. Or not real. or dies easy. Or full of shit.

			Just death. Call it open up and live. Call it mystery man. Music. Call it hey hey hey eureka the freaka, say, ART! Let it rain fire but it wont because it cdnt in the birdbath martini fingertip silences, pages can be turned but have silly shit in em. quiet death. Cheever in cold. in sides of stuff with no outsides. no connect. no heat except from furnaces if you got oil. no warm – no warm – no meaning. Ashes! Ashes! White people Academy Awards. Ashes! Niggers in dinner jackets! Ashes, Fat nigger with comments. Niggers with pulitzer prize cover story schizophrenia is OK. be a indian. be anonymous. but dont be no indian like brown and off somewhere hurting. be an indian if you aint an indian. if you really an indian be something else. Ashes. Relics. Lets be relics, but not too much of a relic. Not way back to black relics. no black relics. vanished. lied. Stolen. Not like the shit the pope got hid in his museum. something without blood. without sweat. without words passing through ears. Ashes.

			& no selves. Bombs are cool. Beatniks like bombs. Bombs are cool. Ashes.

			Death. Racism. Lies. Chauvinism. Oppression. Exploitation. Frustration. White movies. TV with only Nell Carter and the nigger midget. And Benson. Fake families. Artificial. Be artificial. Be Oscar Wilde. But dont try to fuck. Be cute. but no fucking. Stop fucking. Freaky fucking is OK in a newspaper or rolled up in a window shade. or in a book. No fucking. No babies. No real shit. No cold except cold as nothing nothing out there. Ashes. Let bombs fall. Let killing be everything then nothing. Conan the barbarian. Reagan the Conan. Ashes. Fighting shd be over, peace. not peace where people are happy. but peace of death. death peace. peace of death. silence and ice death ashes. fire is over. traces of fire is OK but no fire in nothing. no heart of eye fire. no fire for food, except if cooked by silent nigger, or laughing nigger, or different kinds of colored darkies who can be called names.

			But no selves, hear? No breathing. No dancing. Except if you bounce. No rhythm. Either be on the wall or off the wall. But be against people having intelligence without degrees. No intelligence without degrees. Be for Norman Podhoretz dream of a world of ashes in which Reagan is crowned Lord God of Barbarians. Uphold Barbarians. Uphold Tarzan. Be Boy. Appoint Cheetah as Civil Rights Commissioner.

			Uphold blackface but kill black faces. Darkies are great. Guys who can get along, and Gals. Uphold Gals. Pat em on the ass if it wiggles. Big ass Gals. And ashes. And bouncing. Be for bouncing. Bounce. And Death, Be for death. Death from the skies. Death as a result of barbarian economies. Greed Death. Stupid Death. Hail to Stupid Death & Bouncing. Hail to Awkward Dumb shit. And death. And sky death. And Gestapos and Nazis. Be for preachers who want to burn books. and Ashes. And bouncing. And death. No selves. No collections of them. Kill collections of selves. Alone is OK. solipsism. greed. Individualism. and death. And ashes. And cold sand instead of warmth, or vibrance or rhythms, or intelligence loose in the world. Dead art. Art with feathers. Denying Art. Schizophrenic art. Ruler Art. Museum Art. No artists who want information or the world in it.

			silence any art with the world in it or close to it or talking or thinking. kill light and heat that is among us. kill us. there is no us. only blindness and ice ages. no science. no love. no reason. no family. no communities of intelligence. no development. no loving human peace. Ashes. Stanley. Livingston. Sky death. No selves. dumbness. dull poems. bouncing. assassinations. klan sympathies. and ashes. and imperialist war. yes, that finally, and everything thing thing thing thing that supports or justifies it. stupid exclusive national chauvinism and RU (what))) and sidekicks and ashes and bouncing atomic war thats what we need atomic war we gonna get it theres no we, us i’s is gonna, aint no us/es no no no only death and ashes and bouncing, no selves, fuck you kill you niggers, anythings, nothing but atomic death from rich people there is only ashes and bouncing thats all no love no selves no peace only atomic war and death and ashes thats all no no no self no no no no selves no no no no world no no no no no no no

WHY IT’S QUIET IN SOME CHURCHES


			just a closeta walk with thee

			Not a pin drops. No breathing. Please, please no sound.

			(“Make them niggers cut out that ‘tom foolery’. Jesus,

			ain’t in Georgia!”)

			You cannot make noise or the spirit will hear

			We’ll nail up your mouth if you try to sing

			We changed the spelling of Prophet to Profit

			We changed Soul to Sole

			We covered spirit with a ghost

			We changed Sun to Son, and with the help of the right Farther

			and knowledge of What Goest? He cd get his rightful inheritance.

			No. we took the mother out. We burned broads from Salem to Troy.

			From Soweto to Philadelphia to transform the pyramid of life

			to a triangle of death. We took the head and nuts off the ankh

			changed the life sign to a cemetery advertisement. Then had mfs

			wear death around the necks they wd long for it so. We dis connected

			creativity and art. But if it ain’t no creativity ain’t no art, and if ain’t

			no art even the schools must close, and the schoolmen go back to

			Hairy Mystery!

			The Father The Son And The Holy Ghost is a Joke

			What happened to the Mother, Fools! There is no

			life without the mortar and the pestle, the thing and

			the thang, without boys and girls, women and men

			in their blue quivering funk rising till jism

			brings a new day.

			We created tragedy by killing our fathers, fucking our mothers

			putting out our own eyes, and wandering the world as a advertisement for “modernism”

			We separated thought from feeling. We thought feeling wd stop

			us thinking, or vice versa. But then I do want to bore you.

			And the cross roads we took recrossed, recrossed, and the cold north

			was not that any more, but we were anyway, and then to exist was only possible

			w/ the slandered smoke of tortured change. From its we became ex-its!

			We were signs but w/o the seed, blind, we had egos instead of eggs

			the missing excitement, Gee, Baby, Sin! Our epitaph!

			How per fect that it was a Muslim

			Fundamentalist, one who shot Meir

			Kahane (and was acquitted) the one

			who was to be deported, one eyed

			priest of an evil violent Muslim

			cult. And it smells like Saddam or

			The PLO, Quadaffi, Khomeini, the death threat

			on Rushdie. Their hatred of Jews, their bloody

			terrorism. And cheap greasy brown foreign

			primitive violence.

			The Mossad could do it, with the Serbs, cover the slaughter

			of Muslims in Bosnia. The Spook, Lee,

			explained to niggers, for us, how Nigger

			Muslims killed Malcolm. Farrakhan’s

			a Muslim. Elijah Muhammad. Malcolm

			X was a Muslim.

			It will be simple, like Americans,

			& greed will become

			moral outrage.





ART AGAINST ART NOT


			Art Not is Devil Death

			Delusion

			like emptiness

			Silence

			the dark

			ignorance

			That everything that exists

			is alive

			Whatever there wasiswill

			Space encompasses, yet the

			truth stares from it

			invisible as most

			of where we are

			We are in the body of space

			as space

			in specific lives

			& waves

			Like foot prints breathing

			you’d have to

			Know

			as you tune in with everything

			possibility exists

			alive

			But space is filling

			nurtures

			the child

			the sun

			Where the history

			thrusts as longing

			withheld

			gravity

			bursts

			the outcome

			the meaning

			inside the black hole

			memory

			grew

			the 1st dick

			to speak

			Space

			is speech

			the snake of Lightning

			Thunder clouds

			Black snake the tongue of the world a blue

			chord coming the milky way, the jizm

			the stars shot out in. The electrical “Yes”

			of livingness eternal as truth, beyond ourselves

			yet in which we will always be part of however!

			In that sudden sea of fire, memory becomes

			consciousness, the fetus’ tail becomes a solo

			low & crawling across the earth, yet wise enough

			to introduce the naked “people” to reality

			& science. Even against the will of their

			cruel invisible (land) Lord who told them that

			ignorance is obedience. Mystery is

			Holiness. Expelled from paradise for listening

			to the black talking snake, Dick Tongue, Blood is a see

			song, the pen and the sword, Question & Answer.

			The snake counciled the Whys & The Wise. Moving

			like life itself, matter contradicted by motion

			yet defining its existence & atom of universal

			unity.

			The snake told the truth the invisible priest

			hid knowledge to stay powerful. It was he who

			brought the apple trees. Wasn’t no Apple trees

			in Africa before G got invisible & decreed the people be naked

			too ignorant to live forever. And re enter inner

			space closer to becoming again the consciousness of what

			exists, Forever.

			Spirit is created & continues through matter. The snake

			carries the sun rising up & down, like

			the heart beat, like lovers, waves of light

			& see. The Snake whose name

			begins with the same letter as the Sun, the twisting

			rising breath of the world.

			Blues

			our favorite color

			ultra violet

			the soul is invisible

			when it arrives

			turning indigo

			as it

			Grows visible

			From the light

			of consciousness

			rising

			The Soul

			is the Sun’s

			History

			it comes to understand

			life

			it’s loss

			The Blown

			The Blowing

			The Blue

			Mother Sky

			of the transparent

			Endlessness

			we blow

			The Blues

			of sky & water

			Wherein we wail

			to bring forth the sea

			the revelation of blow top

			Outness

			to go into the

			Farther

			the way out

			Trane blows all night

			Getting Happy

			The Good News just above

			The future is the lowest

			heaven

			comes


So it is the seeds wrapped in a bag

			resembling infinity

			the tallness

			of the next

			moment


When we were free

			We were blue

			but we blew

			& became the blues

			the beautiful sky & water

			the sad song of the Sun

			travelin

			light

			Because the Sun

			is Blue

			& the world motor

			weres

			the engine

			is history

			Whirring

			in side


Yet Life became Money

			the Green Giant

			a television Star

			Gold at the Height

			O.J.

			*

			Understand the quest & the mystery.

			That the circle, the whole is an entrance

			a hole, a slit where from the old tongue

			split by contradictions within, the dimension

			& isness, what mothers, the me of am continuing

			as so connected to everything by getting down

			the blues lights the sky orgasm defines

			little fish predicting Jesus coming

			from inside the womb, the ego

			of the earth traveling as mountains & breasts

			pointing at the mother from the “gift”, the

			answer, yr question is a woman creating

			the next is, the tale slipping out of the

			exclamation of illusion from the mouth

			of truth, everything from nothing, the new

			like there is silence,

			the last refinement

			to speak as the sleep of electricity. The

			whole, the all ways turns like a full moon

			yet who can stare at the sun, the name

			of what knew is the reality of “forever”.

			The snake was music the visible thought

			the answer, as the Sea crawls in waves

			the waves of is’ story the shared center

			What tells nature’s needs the real U

			the returning self following the soul

			back to the right on, the mother

			electric exploding measure as

			a mirror, the wetness drenches

			us with forever as a reflection

			of the self’s search for consciousness

			we can become the matter of understanding

			digging itself reexplain the history

			of it’s actuality, it’s life, the

			sign in the sky the unseen catching

			a glimpse of it’s Knowing, which being

			is the self of it’s will, the route

			from which come comes, the forth

			dimension which is motion, the on

			switch, the self of everything as light

			to see the egg on fire with vision

			The body of Who, The Yes O Cean

			which we leave when smart enough

			to confuse naked people

			that knowledge is sin

			Be is the self twisting & rising & changing

			the Beast is King, the body of is “visible” is

			so the sea of gestation the waves of light

			The I of the snake, history sings the self vision

			to be a beast, the soul, anima, as the connector

			of truth. What matter/is. Our mother – “life w/o

			end”, our father, the distance we are from

			the creation of the world ourselves as perfect

			& alive forever

			To be perfect is to be “invisible” forever

			like the inside & outside of the circle. The

			Snake lied & became the lion. The naked people

			were put out of paradise for believing a snake.

			The loins became cloth & sex

			mysterious & dirty.

			The tree of Knowledge told them

			nothing valuable. Like the Greek tortured

			for stealing fire. Socrates poisoned. The Sphinx

			sits fixed by her animal lower self. Her

			visible self at the top is a woman

			There is the soul of what creates, Alma

			Mater, staring into the white invisible sky

			human connected to no motion by an animal

			the King of the Animals, crouching on his tale

			headless as King, a powerful beast, who

			cannot move disconnect from his eyes

			Yesterday a comet fell into Jupiter from

			the sky (at thousands of miles a second)

			in massive fire balls of explosion

			Sun Ra arrives

			Don’t think that twisting Blankness of dead caves

BLACK RECONSTRUCTION


			OH FREEDOM segue to BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC

			What the Doctor explained

			was that we had fought

			that we had patiently

			rushed into our trans

			formed

			selves.

			That we had run away

			from the plantations & closed

			them down. That we had

			plagued our liberators

			to let us be liberated.

			And offered our whole selves

			as proof that God is real.

			And we are his children.

			And that there is a

			Spirit in our suffering

			that beats like twilight

			red rain brown lit up

			with thunder.

			I cd see that then,

			What that roar within us

			the cymbals sharp &

			glowing hot, as we put

			on blue again, & became

			ourselves, where we were,

			as the angels in the chariot

			ourselves, getting down to

			make heaven our home.

			That is the way it was told

			When we put the Blue on

			Again. With yes, the Blue

			Steel bayonets, and the speech

			of the prophets fashioned

			out weapons of fire.

			Then that rush, of a Gideon

			Screaming madness high up

			John Coltrane Savage Nigger

			African Explosion Color

			That the Freedom! The that

			the yeh say what Bam!

			Splat volcano language

			of Free – Do you, The Free

			The Bird – My sign, on my face

			the skin raised, to show

			out of fire, sky nut sperm

			the jism that made the world

			all the non stop lovely goodness

			unstoppable screaming

			It was like the ascension

			itself, after 40 days

			we were exploded into

			the endless inspiration

			To understand our lives

			as they exist

			in the

			Spirit

			World

			the freedom of

			the always

IN THE FUGITIVE


			Richard Kemble kept insisting

			he did not kill

			his wife. That the real

			murderer, was a one-armed

			man. He was telling the truth

			all the time. And we knew it!

			In the new series, if you watch

			television, the real murderer

			has become the Republican Senate Majority

			Leader, who goes everywhere

			with a pet lizard

			who defecates through his mouth

			& blows hot green gas out his tale.

			Which, in certain conditions

			oddly resembles low German.

ONE THURSDAY I FOUND THIS

IN MY NOTEBOOK


			When love is perfected, when love

			is understood.

			When love is the law

			& the measure

			The ruler & ruled & body of

			of what is body mind of

			what is mind

			When love & the Soul

			are uncovered

			then you will always

			sound like

			Duke Ellington.





DUKE’S WORLD


			Passion Flower

			for “Strays”

			is the explanation

			beauty makes

			the look of understanding

			a new day being so ancient

			brings

			There is an ascendance in Duke. A passage

			through which you are pulled, where everything

			that lives forever regards itself & lets you know

			you can be there always when you are beautiful

			There is no ugliness that describes Duke’s world

			except what is not

			& how it connects to

			what is

			It is not just the elegance, the irony, the

			sensuous self illumination

			there is also deep happiness

			in Duke’s world

			What you think is a castle, expansive gardens

			is a teacher impeccably in love with

			exaltation & joy. Duke’s world

			is where we go if we are good.





AFRO AMERICAN TALKING DRUM


			Duke

			If you got real spooky

			& became Duke Ellington

			America wd deny it

			just like they did

			to the real Duke

			Ellington


Ellingtonia

			Duke

			speaks for everybody

			& the Devil

			resents

			this!

			It disturbed me

			so much

			I was determined

			to ask him, the

			Devil,

			Why this was

			So. Why did he resent

			Duke Ellington?

			The Devil, not being a

			racist,

			explained

			(& in a very convincing

			way)

			that he didn’t mind

			Duke

			it was his

			music

			that he

			despised!





MONK’S WORLD


			’Round Midnight

			That street where midnight

			is round, the moon flat

			& blue, where fire engines solo

			& cats stand around & look

			is Monk’s world

			When I last saw him, turning around

			high from 78 RPM, growling

			a landscape of spaced funk

			When I last spoke to him, coming out

			the Vanguard, he hipped me to

			my own secrets, like Nat

			he dug the numbers & letters

			blowing through the grass

			initials & invocations of the past

			All the questions I asked Monk He

			answered first

			in a beret. Why was

			a high priest staring

			Why were the black keys

			signifying. And who was

			wrapped in common magic

			like a street empty of everything

			except weird birds

			The last time Monk smiled I read

			the piano’s diary. His fingers

			where he collected yr feelings

			The Bar he circled to underscore

			the anonymous laughter of smoke

			& posters.

			Monk carried equations he danced at you.

			What’s happening?” We said, as he dipped &

			spun. “What’s happening?”

			“Everything. All the time.

			Every googoplex

			of a second.”

			Like a door, he opened, not disappearing

			but remaining a distant profile

			of intimate revelation.

			Oh, man! Monk was digging Trane now

			w/o a chaser he drank himself

			in. & Trane reported from

			the 6th or 7th planet deep in

			the Theloniuscape.

			Where fire engines screamed the blues

			& night had a shiny mouth

			& scatted flying things.





BUDDHA ASKED MONK


			“If you were always right

			would it be Easier

			or more Difficult

			Living In The World?”

			“I knew you’d ask that!”

			Monk said, Blue and

			Invisible.





MONK ZEN


			Monk

			always

			come in a

			place

			later.

			Long after you first see

			him

			come in.

			People say they

			didn’t see him

			leave –

			Miles say

			So What?

			Monk say

			Well, You Needn’t

			Wilbur Ware say

			Me & Shadow & Trane was wit him when he went out

			You musta heard us!





LULLABY OF AVON AVE.


			I used to walk past Sassy’s crib

			a couple times a week, when young

			And each time say, “That’s

			Where Sarah Vaughn lives”.

			That was when Symphony Sid

			used to call her, “The Divine One”,

			Late nights, from hip Bird Land

			Oh man, what a feeling that was

			Divine & so hip & so very

			beautiful.

			The house is gone now

			Symphony Sid too

			As for the town, now

			Sassy told us

			just before she split

			I’m gone, now

			Send in

			The

			Clowns!





THE DARK IS FULL OF TEARS


			When Albert returned from

			the grave, he had no horn. He

			asked us to look for it &

			we agreed.

			He sd he wd return when

			we found it. He was somewhere

			in space, drugged about Religion

			& The Mob.

			I asked him had he been

			murdered.

			“Of course”, Albert wd answer

			most things like this though,

			“Murdered by God! That’s why

			it was stupid to believe

			in him!”

NOTE TO AB


			I became a poet

			Because every thing

			Beautiful seemed

			“poetic” to me.

			I thought there were things

			I didn’t understand

			that wd make the world

			poetry. I felt I knew

			who I was but had to

			Struggle, to catch up

			w/ my self.

			Now I do see me

			sometimes, a few worlds

			ahead, & I speed up, then,

			put my head down,

			Stretch my stride out

			& dig

			There me go, I scat &

			sing, there me go.





TENDER ARRIVALS


			Where ever something breathes

			Heart beating the rise and fall

			Of mountains, the waves upon the sky

			Of seas, the terror is our ignorance, that’s

			Why it is named after our home, earth

			Where art is locked between

			Gone and Destination

			The destiny of some other where and feeling

			The ape knew this, when his old lady pulled him up

			Off the ground. Was he grateful, ask him he’s still sitting up there

			Watching the sky’s adventures, leaving two holes for his own. Oh sing

			Gigantic burp past the insects, swifter than the ugly Stanleys on the ground

			Catching monkey meat for Hyenagators, absolute boss of what does not

			Arrive in time to say anything. We hear that eating, that doo dooing, that

			Burping, we had a nigro mayor used to burp like poison zapalote

			Waddled into the cave of his lust. We got a Spring Jasper now, if you don’t like that

			woid, what about courtesan, dreamed out his own replacement sprawled

			Across the velvet cash register of belching and farting, his knick names when they

			let him be played with. Some call him Puck, was love, we thought, now a rubber

			Flat blackie banged across the ice, to get past our Goli, the Africannibus of memory.

			Here. We have so many wedged between death and passivity. Like eyes that collide

			With reality and cannot see anything but the inner abstraction of flatus, a

			biography, a car, a walk to the guillotine, James The First, Giuliani the Second

			When he tries to go national, senators will stab him, Ides of March or Not. Maybe

			Both will die, James 1 and Caesar 2, as they did in the past, where we can read about

			The justness of their assassinations

			As we swig a little brew and laugh at the perseverance

			Of disease at higher and higher levels of its elimination.

			We could see anything we wanted to. Be anything we knew how to be. Build

			anything we needed. Arrive anywhere we should have to go. But time is as stubborn

			as space, and they compose us with definition, time place and condition.

			The howlees the yowlees the yankees the super left streamlined post racial ideational

			chauvinists creeep at the mouth of the venal cava. They are protesting fire and

			Looking askance at the giblets we have learned to eat. “It’s nobody’s heart”, they

			say, and we agree. It’s the rest of some things insides. Along with the flowers, the

			grass, the tubers, the river, pieces of the sky, earth, our seasoning, baked

			throughout. What do you call that the anarchist of comfort asks,

			Food, we say, making it up as we chew. Yesterday we explained language.





NOTE FROM THE REAL WORLD


			Trail ers form dark story night

			trails of dark cloud see ings

			in built

			out built, to it self’s per fection

			a renegade

			a green glowing shoe

			the antidote to the void

			nothing but forms

			content of revolution

			see change

			it turns a drop of acid, inside out

			it milks a bird of god symbolism, the golden hawk

			oba, father,

			hawk, god from the fertile crescent

			glowing star

			the troops rumbling and their horses rumbling

			the first junkie is a flea, passing into superior consciousness

			in that e poch

			at that parallel, a pyramid

			at that pyramid a blood dressed in triangular apron

			a rod and staff

			the world is a newsflash

			we are with god when he creates

			the stories the poems of the magic city

			the night congregates in its birth. Drama.

			Roach. Scepter. House. They come down together.

			We are the smiler at all that passes and it draws you in,

			dreamer

			the 9th incarnation of

			Vishnu

			Was Bull Moose Jackson





CHAMBER MUSIC


			There might be someone you love, some one you

			wanted to be with, and then, found your self

			with, there were such things, such lives and

			lovers. I am like that sometimes, I think, some

			distant romantic wrapped in music. I wanted to know

			myself, and found that was a lifetime’s work, the

			twists and zig zags, dips and turns, all could

			disorient you, that you were no longer you but

			somebody else masquerading as yourself’s desire.

			Rain could come. The sky grow light. It could even be

			twilight, in a foreign town. Where you walked under

			far noises of invisible worlds. But when you remember

			all of your faces, blown now gone forever in the wind,

			you’ll see that you were always wanting to be you,

			you were always wanting to know and love yourself, and you

			found a few faces, a few names, that extended your life

			into other lives, and as time marches, hours, days, decades

			dance, you’ll find your hand in someone else’s hand, you’ll

			hear yourself thinking about some person other than you

			and then look up and yes there will be some other person

			some closeness and echoed tenderness, that make us more than dots

			under the far away, that make us more than split seconds of

			light





ARS GRATIA ARTIS


			I would see

			sometimes, shadows spooks

			unoriginal deities, fastened

			in the dark to my dark, there

			alone somewhere, or even in the midst

			of other life, people talking, profound

			criss cross and imaginative sighs, we

			they wd see, someone, it was me, probably

			and the ghosts and monsters of all was here

			ever, returned, to dance their historic

			monster log. Dinosaurs and ape men, saber toothed

			philosophers, pranced ugly in my mind, no, in my

			room, fuck a mind, they were there, everywhere!

			I’d compose music, for the motherfuckers

			lonesome for light, backed against shadows,

			I’d hum for these fiery red bastards out of hell

			I’d sing, Monastic melodies, yeh, Monkish tunes

			to the outside of thought, the far side of anything.

			And they’d dance, and keep on dancing, they’d dance

			and dance, get down all night. That’s how I became

			a poet, singer against terror blue black red terror

			in the ghostly midnights of the central ward. That

			was my first exposure to literature, coming right

			out my mouth, them hot serenades

			to keep the ghosts away. My poetry, then,

			has always been aimed at destroying ugly shit.

			So why, Ronald Reagan, shd you get away?





OKLAHOMA ENTERS THE THIRD WORLD


			After the bombing,

			I saw Americans

			on television

			their faces exiled from

			the candy brain-destroying

			fraud, fakery & Madness

			of their culture.

			They did not look like

			Kewpie Dolls or the ads

			their faces were pulling away

			from the money-dick slavery

			klan wax nazi white

			supremacy primitive cave

			savage airbrushed, violent

			greedy ignorant culture.

			The wax faces melted with their

			eyes, and they, for a moment, felt

			the truth.

			And for that moment came

			into the world, & like most

			of the rest of us

			in the world.

			They were actually, crying.





GOT ANY CHANGE?


			Instead of this street

			With its wasted brothers

			Asleep on the corners

			So the crack jackers

			Have to step over them

			W/ the cuss out laugh

			Of the soon to be wasted

			Themselves.

			Instead of this street

			In a city, where aint nothin

			Pretty, but the people

			Who keep on standing

			& really laughing &

			actually underneath our night

			make love to each other

			even if they fight.

			A city ruled by a Negro

			Ghoul, a sepia Lieutenant Nazi

			With licence to fool, a looney

			Tunes coon, so skilled

			At deception, everything he thinks

			Is a lie, and he has had his

			Snoring altered to resemble

			Casual remarks

			We are in New Ark, the Brick

			City, Like I sd

			Where only the people

			Are pretty

			& they have a hell of a

			time being that

			Ruled by his dishonor, the May Whore

			Who has crowned

			Hese’f Emperor, His Majesty

			The Rat

			Ghost brain

			In a rubber brown

			“Black Man” costume

			Like TB spit.

			He sick, always laughing

			To cover the fact he has no face.

			& Like post Dallas JFK look for his brain

			aint even a trace

			So we have climbed the ladder

			To this, where white folks

			Seem to recede to the margins

			Of our pain, and their

			Black substitutes are prostitutes

			And clinically insane.

			We are being taught about classes

			And class struggle

			& the people of whatever color

			are not what they look like

			but exactly how they act, a cold fact

			We are in a city ruled by

			A mad nigger punk

			A Mobutu, Abacha

			Backward petty bourgeois

			Heels and Scum

			Who serve imperialism &

			Corporate rule,

			Who hate Black People

			Any poor people

			They are well made tools

			We must overthrow

			These negro asst. beasts

			Loathsome things

			For whom evil is sexual release

			Are they puppets? Ask them?

			They’ll tell you they aint no such thing

			They’re just very very smart, you know,

			They get to help the rulers pull their strings.

			Negroes like Sharpe James from the most backward





BETWEEN INFRA-RED & ULTRA-VIOLET


			We are the inside of reality, what move it and turn it up

			Around and on on, we are the where you been and the there

			You go, we ain’t perfect, we ain’t even rich, we ain’t that believable sometime, what we

			want. What we say, all the upside inside by George they went off like that, stuff.

			We are the silent and the loud. The quiet blue in the sky of morning, the murmuring

			Redness makes when the sun books to light up the rest of the family.

			We are old as anything but never stay anywhere too long. We invented whatever you

			Can say, except we dont want to take credit for bad shit, but we invented that

			Too. My man over there invented God, on a humble, under a tree and jimmy dropped

			A load on his head. He said God and that got over for dough. My wife invented

			Bread, from flowers. I said it was a good idea then went off trying to bite a tree. I

			Climbed up in a tree second. She was first. I invented quizzical expressions and long

			Silences. I thought up music the way the sky wanted to get in our business all the Time.

			We are everywhere you been and where you going we let you know to go there. Your

			boy in the corner sleep invented the devil and got his behind whipped by his own

			theory. Then tried to lock up what it brought. He invented jails too and was the first

			one in one. The dude over there crying invented the church now he trying to explain

			what he meant.

			We are the fall as it lets you dig it. The spring as you walk through it smiling. We are

			Rain. Light and heavy. And fire when it simmers under our food. I thought up speech

			When my toe got broke trying to eat a flower. The sky I used to call sister All and

			Thought Shango was doing it do her. I got here second. My wife was first. I wanted to keep on hunting on the ground. Till the bite marks made me look like one of them ugly cats who wanna sink they teeth in your next is.

			We were here when anybody thought to think up being here. We was invited to be

			Humans and thought we had copped. We was communists covered with our natural

			Vines. Let it go for groceries. Then had to cut out when the grocer got ugly.

			We was big fish and could sing then. We was wailing in the water, and dug light was

			In the waves. We explained tides and kept records when Bird was jet black and

			Crisscrossed overhead chasing the sun. We figured out what the soul was watching

			Him. I could sing when my fingers come out.

			We lived everywhere there is, and know everything but what we need to know next.

			We the only people never been nowhere that don’t exist. We dream in the billions.

			Your boy, the dog with the hat on, invented money. That’s why he got a gun. He say

			Somebody wanna waste him.

			We are the shadows that haunt what shouldn’t stay around. We are the whispers of

			The future’s wings. The engines of the spirit, the breath of the earth, the dirt, the lips

			Of the water. The beating of the day night day night. I come here second. Where was I

			Before? Before is not anybody you know. I used to play the drums when they growed

			Up in my hand. I sat in a tree and thought up numbers. I was a revolutionary from

			way back, ask that cat with my bad talk in his ear and new foot up his ass. I confess

			Evil was an experiment. Don’t hold it against me. I knew it was risky and told your boy

			Jacoub. He dug it later and started a singing group.

			We was so out we went away and came back to go again and made a circle to have

			Something to say. Eating was the way we walked. I was never alone I come here

			Second, my wife was first.

			We know what need to be and keep talking about it. We is singers and drummers and

			Horn players and poets and painters and sculptors and dancers and actors and

			Workers and runners. My man over there thought up flying but then had to come

			back when he went to where he started. We was planets and stars. We was notes and

			rests. We walked before the clouds asked us to. We was hungry before we knew

			about food.

			We is revolutionary day into night into star into somewhere look up we coming again.

			We is you too. We is two you. We is come and gone coming and going. Loving and

			digging, laughing and copping. Listening and singing. Dancing and timing. We is

			space and time as a picture card of everything we is revolutionaries. The world is not

			what it will be. We is what will make it that and then. We is the never of the yes/ the

			tiny of the grand. The hotness of the coolth. The seeing of the believing the practice of

			the theory. The history of the future. The lost of the found we are what you need and

			what you get if you stay around. We are what we was when you are where you going.

THE EDUCATION OF THE AIR


			They said they don’t want anything or

			Any body. They were lying, and they

			Knew it. They knew they were telling

			The truth. You and I know they were

			Telling the truth. But then how could they

			Be lying. How could they be lying?

			First, the older world, is turned back again

			And the people who rule it are neither women

			Nor men. They are inside a thing, inside it. And who

			Ask for them sees nothing but tilted shadows, lying, made of brick or

			Paper. They are inside the other things you cannot see, or if you see them

			They see you first and have already planned your death or imprisonment.

			Sometimes they will imprison you in paper or words, or sometimes

			They will imprison you inside yourself. Where you be screaming but

			Cannot hear yourself. Such as it be. Such as you cannot see. Call me

			A black whole, call the world a mystery. So when he said that he wanted

			Nothing and nobody he was telling the “truth” as far as he knew it.

			But clearly he did not know it.

			Did the truth know him? The truth could speak but it was drowned by itself

			As Evil. Evil speaks the truth and so do lies. Sometimes the lie is truer

			Than the truth. Because many times the truth is a lie. And a lie

			Is the truth. Get it!

			So he lived alone with his own truth lying. And the lie was clearly true.

			Or have you ever, one day, have you never, the next day. Like standing

			On the corner for thirty-five years expecting to be shot. But nothing.

			So you go back home and the corner comes in the door behind you.

			And there you are not shot then shot.

			So be found out he had been lying by telling the truth as he knew it.

			But not knowing he didn’t know he knew a lie as the truth.

			So when he found out, he found in. When he opened his eyes

			His mouth opened too. He was calling, and this was startling.

			He was calling. It was shocking. Because he had never known

			He was calling. But he had been calling all the time. And never

			Knew it.

			He was calling when he discovered he was calling, for what he

			Said he didn’t want. Thing and Body. Every not any. All things

			And all bodies. It was true he had always been calling, Even though

			He didn’t know it, even though he didn’t hear himself. Even though

			He was lying when he was convinced he was telling the truth





EVERY FULL MOON


			I get horrible letters

			From Ghosts

			Demanding

			Money

			I pay them

			Because there are no laws

			Against Instortion

			The legal term for “Threatening

			Demands for Money, &c

			Made by Dead People.”

			But if you burn

			These “Williams”

			’s what the Ghosts

			call ’em,)

			& say the same words

			Mantan Moreland

			Used to,

			when he was

			pulling Security

			For Charlie Chan’s

			“Number One Son”

			“Oh Oh!

			Oh Oh!

			Oh Oh!”

			THREE TIMES!

			The Ghosts might not stop sending them letters

			Right Away

			But they probably wont be able

			to Find Out

			Where you went to!

WHO IS YOU?


			Verse Drama

			Who is who?

			Who is You?

			I is I and me and the you you asked who is you

			There. I thought so. A runt

			What is a runt?

			A runt is something moving fast then stopping abruptly. The T is the ceiling, a sky dimensioning what runt is.

			No, no, you missed understand by several shades. I is still running, upward and onward, in fact I cd be called a running.

			Oh, you are into language. The “ing”, representing You I Self connecting N, with new birth; the mysterious god of money and power

			Discourse. I is the on of on going and gone. Up and away

			Are you Clark Kent?

			Lemme See. Clark, the scribe, well in a way. Kent, Connected . . . well yes . . . ha ha, well connected

			Is the connected emphasizing the Con or the Nec? Is the ending the sky of gone or is it an email ending for some institution, dropping the you.

			All, both, any way you say that makes me toppermost in the uttermost

			You’re, then, not a ghost?

			How cd I be a ghost and you see me?

			Why do you think I see you?

			Are you talking to air?

			That’s what you think, that I’m talking to You?

			Oh, boy . . . be serious

			I’m not that high yet. Serious is as far out as we can see and still be here in Africa You can see me though, cant you

			Of course not. I smell you. I feel you. I almost understand you. But See you, that’s pretty far out. No I know you are there, I see your clothes, your words clogging the thoroughfares of thought. But see you . . . well perhaps, but only through a glass

			You’re quoting the bible. I thought you were an atheist?

			I don’t shrink from titles others lay out. Atheist if that suits your trumpet and tin can.

			Do you believe in God or not?

			I know you’re not God. And I don’t believe in anything that’s immaterial. Ideas are reflections of material life. Why are you representing yourself as the big G?

			Ha ha, I got G’s but I aint he . . . ha ha . . . Well, do you believe in Spirit?

			Of course, that’s how I picked yr whatnot up out the ether. Yr grinding big boy ugly twizzle . . . like a raw acid weeping into our lives

			Our? What do you mean by that? Our . . .

			All, Most, the people, the majority, the mass of beings

			You believe in that?

			Yes, that’s what I do believe in. You don’t

			There’s no proof there is anything real except myself, a class if you like, and it’s appetites.

			Class? You admit there’s a class then you admit to others.

			No. Class is the body of the living entity, that inhabits all of what exists except that tiny rat hole that you thrust your nonsense out of. Only G can make a tree. But only I class can make a G

			Well done, over cooked, hard and rubbery like a burnt snake. You only. Class I you that with no them or any other.

			Exactly. Do you sing? Or dance. Can you hum or drum. I’ve got use for what you ain’t if you can be that as interest. Seven, eight, 10 percent The rest is appetite. Eating.

			Tiny rat hole. Whoa. Don’t you think that a little insulting. I don’t even know you. Make yourself visible so I can spit on you. Or maybe hit you with an iron pipe. Or throw you down and stomp you in the chest,

			I am visible. That’s your defect, your manifest inferiority, that I can be seen but you don’t see me.

			Does that mean you’re obscene?

			In a way. Un scene is better the UN The Class The One The Theness of the not we nor us I ing . . . Check that

			Could I pour food color where your voice is and see you then?

			Try it!

			Can I spray the blood of dead martyrs where your words hang momentarily and trace you that way?

			Try that too

			Suppose I got all the hungry people in the world to surround this spot where your talk comes from. Could I isolate you and waste you even without seeing you actually.

			Can you do that?

			I’ll try

			Look, don’t waste your time. I admit it, I am G, I don’t use drugs so I don’t include the OD.

			Don’t use, just Sell

			Exactly

			What do you use?

			Everything that’s not me, to big myself into something lovable intelligent wise compassionate logical rational legal holy traditional innovative profitable

			Do you consider your self Human?

			NO, as I sd, I am G. There is no such thing as a Human.

			Who am I?

			A Bad Dream, continuing into the late afternoon.

			Suppose I am not a Dream. Suppose I am Real. Suppose there are others. Suppose there are even Humans. Suppose you are a runt with a good cover story. Suppose you can be seen, and surrounded, and caught, and brought to trial. And Locked up. Or even executed?

			You don’t believe in the Death Penalty!

			I would kill your voice, your ideas, your meaning, perhaps archive it with a photo of your notness to educate the others even if you never understood there are others.

			Suppose everything I told you is a lie. And I am human, and a class and I know there are others. And that even you exist. But I like the way things are, except you being here taunting me with questions. Suppose suppose all that. Suppose, that everything you think and thought or will think about me is true. That I am somehow . . . what

			Evil? Ugly? Ravenous? Greedy? Insane? A murderer? A Liar? A destroyer of Life and people. A kind of real devil. A Slavemaster? An Imperialist?

			Now wait. Don’t get carried away. So if I admit that I am a real thing, a class, and even most of those things . . . you say. . . . Slavemaster I can take . . . a Kind of Devil even, rest in piss, but an Imperialist. I don’t use such language. I don’t understand such language. I have 10,000 ignorant serial killer perderasts pumping what I need from all channels, stations, web sites, newspapers, schools, books, cds, and you want to resist with what? You don’t have anything to fight me with but your tears, your whining, your empty frustration, your threat of humans and others . . . Bah

			Are you up to challenges?

			Oh . . . please I don’t have all day. You still can’t see me can you?

			I want you to actually materialize. To be a real thing I can see, that I can point to and tell others, even if they don’t exist, and even touch. I want you to do that, though you say it is all a fantasy, a bad dream, a rat hole perception. Still would you humor me and show your self in a way that would allow me the non-existent us to dig you, just for tough face glory?

			You must be a nut and worse think I’m a nut.

			Ok, you are a coward. But . . . let’s do it this way. List all the things you hate!

			Hmm- Everything that’s not me, which therefore, could not exist

			So you hate everything that can exist not being you?

			Exactly

			Well suppose I pull all that stuff that’s not you that couldn’t exist, suppose for my own rat hole humor I pulled all together, some way, if I could do that, would you help you.

			Oh, well, just to stop this . . . of course, whatever you can do to pull together what is not me that does not exist that couldn’t exist, I will help you do it. How?

			Just by being even more you than you are now. Just by being gigantic you monster you incredibly everywhere appetite you . . . just by letting what does exist, all that, feel you more and more and somehow understand that they can’t exist because only you and the rat hole could exist. Then what

			OK, done, being done, will be done . . . and on . . . then what?

			Well the rest is up to the rat hole, the non-existent others, the humans who never was, the rest is up to the can’t be and wont be and wasn’t. But then . . .

			But then, Goodbye. . . . I’ll be everywhere as usual. . . .

			That’s right And we’ll see finally what is real and what aint and what that means

			Hey, its been stimulating

			At least, perhaps enlightening.





FASHION THIS, FROM THE IRONY

OF THE WORLD.


			That I, the undaunted Laureate of the place,

			daunted in some

			Un as yet/ed pre tense of what they see, they be

			As if, such where they was

			Was yet to be, and then to say

			They is, and is not, like revelations, wow!

			Humans. The skin, the lodging inside dumbness a slight breeze frees they speech

			To speak as if acquainted with small things in the world. Eating, Belching, Farting,

			Murder, Robbery.

			And so. As if, and them too they is. But nothing further

			But the wee dots on the deletion resembling the minds of them

			Yet to come.

			Imagine you were me, or imagine you were thee

			And we knew all the things both do. And is. And will ourselves

			To be. Imagine you were in this place, and they wanted to run everywhere pointless

			endless understanding not even why

			They smell or they hair fall out, or what to do about

			Gout. That they are yet stupid to colds and cancer and death— They think holy

			And ultimate. When death is simply a report card

			Of the ignorant. Nothing dies but that which never lived

			And it might return in a white suit and in charge of ugly small mistakes

			Somebody at Harvard could win a billion dollars and a post

			If they cd find out but they never will because it is the reason

			They committed suicide

			Suppose you had to live with

			Ignorant white people and negroes

			In cages, with important chains

			Around they mouths. Suppose you

			Had heard of Trent Lott. Suppose, you woke up one am

			And there was a vampire on the tube

			Being interviewed by a Niggalino boob

			A handsome rat, for whom the idea of brain

			Was only an idea, which he did not think if he could

			Was a bad one. And the boob was a killer yet to graduate

			From killer school so he worshipped the vampire’s teeth,

			The two juicy fangs hanging from each end of his lip,

			The negro thought was hip. And dreamed of having

			Teefs like that so he could be a rat, he was tired of being

			A mere heel. And the vampire was planning to bite the whole

			World. To suck the blood out of everything. To suck the blood

			Out of the world and make its future a vampire, that could whirl through

			Space and suck the blood out of the stars, suck the blood out of the planets

			Suck the blood out of the moon, suck the blood out of the sun

			And then, armed and blubbery fat with everything’s blood, still hot

			And musical like emptiness, he could lift into the outer waygonesphere

			And search for God, if there was such, and suck the blood out of Him, Her, It, Them

			Whatever, till there was no Blood anywhere, not even you, Blood, in fact

			You be one of the first to go.

			It was a special issue of Jungle Comics, where the vampire the thin nosed kind

			From the out back, who can suck with his teef and stir with his nose, who eyes

			Are missing, and what you see is the bottom of a cold mine filled with 2000 fathoms

			Of Lynch, Execution, Missing, Rape, Cheated, Framed, Slandered, Stolen, Frown

			frozen ex corpuscles, hid under the glistening listening underwater ASSCRAFT of

			the Satanic moron cult, whose breath is toxic and pokes holes in the sky so dead things

			Can shit on our food.

			He is called Fonnghool the asshole, and dances to dry lips set on fire by missing

			junkies he has eaten. He is the devil’s newspaper and wears his ass backwards so the colon can

			Wear a uniform. And Revelations can be burned especially 18:12 where it say

			beware of ugly mother fuckers who is not really ugly mother fuckers but uglier

			much, much, much more uglier dan dat! So spake Nat! Amen. (

			I speak with the rage of Angels

			Them that be with Marx.

			I speak with the clarity and inferno of the necessary

			Like my man John on Patmos watching skyvision and

			Digging it was all commercials.

			I speak like Ali Baba, (“The Arabian Pope”)

			who when he spoke the magic words,

			“Open this sucker up”, and the mountain swang, envisioned one day

			There would be a John named Trane who would blow the same shit

			I blow with the deep fear of John on the island looking at the actual devil

			I am like him in that I try to count the mammyjammers heads and horns

			And find out what will kill him.

			I speak like him who spoke to Philadelphia and hung out with Jesus

			Before they murdered him. I speak like him who dug that Peter

			Was a coward and gave the Lord up, and that Paul was an Anti-Semite

			Who never came out the closet.

			I speak as one who knew Judas would drop a dime on the Movement

			And confirmed the chump had hung his lousy self just before I got busted.

			I speak as one betrayed by the lies of those who say they are religious but

			Are greed ridden worshippers of Satan, who kill any one who opposes them

			and calls it a church of Defense against Evil.

			Like John, I wd speak, like the John who baptized, like John the knower, John,

			The Blower. John the Brown and John The Revelator. I speak like James the

			Brother, James the other, Jim the hip, like Dick the Rude, like Bird the high, like

			Monk the Deep I speak from the island of my soul, and cast a terrified look into the

			sky filled with monsters, with witches and devils with Great Whores and Beasts, of

			things with heads and horns and blood dripping out of their eyes.

			It is out, imagine, you were here, in this place, staring into the soul of something

			Filthy, trying to keep it from murdering you, to keep your eyes from registering

			Your ears from hearing, your mouth from reporting. And you could feel it

			breathing on your neck and saw sometimes the shadow of its horny hands reaching out of the

			Blind dark you cd see the shadow of its gun its lie its teeth sweating. Imagine you

			could actually understand its obscene ideas, and they made you enter the mind of

			Fred Douglass And stare out at the ocean just as John at the edge of Africa, staring at the

			Overhead commercials on the death of the Beast.

			And so the blessing that is in my name and in my words, I give to myself

			And you who are truthful as the actual life of the world. And it is this blessing

			Which will save us, will make us strong, as we go on with our work of scientifically

			Determining how to kill the beast. Each night I fill my notebooks with formula

			And instructions to myself and others on what to do of what to study of where to

			Go who to talk to and when. I make lists of words, names, events, processes,

			necessary stages of what we have come to realize is protracted. And what we do we will do.

			And what we succeed at, is worth the pain, what we fail at, is worth the

			understanding if we can understand. What the next step is. We are studying with all

			our minds and hearts and souls’ determination to understand how to slay the serpent. This task

			Nat handed down to whoever did understand that that was what he did, hanging on

			That tree. Slain by the Serpent’s hosts.

			So we have learned that we can not die except by our own submission to it.

			And have decided we will not die except when we understand what place we go to.

			And so begin to set that where in order and begin to understand where the beast

			Will be hiding there. We are the Rider of The Black Horse. Black Horse Black

			Rider, who conquers with a scale. With Justice and Measure and the mighty

			pentatonic mode of the finite music of infinity, a new joint . . .

			And when I returned from this forwarding of my feeling and knowing

			The beast sat still and teeth wiggled with lies and at once I remembered where

			Before I’d seen him, before his tenure as the Counterfeit Ghost

			of The Caucasian Crib. Yes, it was the same one. Remember the little

			Devil Gerald 2X arrested and placed in the pages of Muhammad Speaks

			And we saw him where Malcolm had locked him up, with the little

			Horns out his head the evil eyes and the twin fang straws for sucking oil and blood.

			It got clear to me as he rose to leave, and the negro boob slobbered happiness

			At being recognized as the newest commode in the Caucasian abode, the vampire

			Turned and where before the cunning little tail that used to dangle out his hiney

			Struck me at its absence, Oh, I thought, and at that moment I saw the thing dart

			Like a copper head’s fart out of the negroes curled lips, ringed with the white chalk

			Caucasian Circle of Merit which identifies Wooden Negroes promoted to the

			honorary genus of Homo Locus Subsidere (literally, “Near Man”), who no longer

			kneel when they are made well paid heels, but now can assume the funky bedbug crouch of the

			Hideously self hating. At the same time, they are given a grey facsimile carte blanche

			Weapon of Ugliness to use against N words and any who wd violate the sanctity

			Of northern appetite! And so I came to understand that the beast’s deadly arrow,

			Shot from out the 1st horseman’s white bow, from the white horse, the weapon

			which Revelations prophesied to John, was the weapon of his transitory rule, was now

			The tongue of the boob, whom I err at calling him that, or rat, or heel, or dog, or

			Traitor. That tail become a tongue was the sign, that from the vampire’s tail

			Was bestowed on the wooden negro a badge that allowed him to enter Klan meetings,

			Skin Head Lynchings, Texas Executions, Palestinian Ethnic Cleansings, and report

			With the slobber of his terrificatious white ringed serpents beak, symbol, font &

			punctuation on the tabula rasa of the media sheet the empty echo of his eviscerated

			Self, and in the soul’s place that beast’s tail was hung that beast’s tale was sung.

			And I stood, remembering Patmos, and the images that sailed across the air

			When you and I was there. And wondered what next the world of this life held for those

			Who would love goodness.

I AM SENT PHOTOGRAPHS OF

MY AUNT GEORGIA’S 90TH BIRTHDAY PARTY IN SOUTH CAROLINA


			They don’t know they

			Horrible. How could they. To look, at, like that, that woman who was once

			So full of breath, the sun, life, to me

			That winter I was undesirably discharged

			From America. Oh Say Can you, Jezzus H. Christ, Ya fuckin –A-

			Tweety, inside me, in the world, out on the dim grim distant howling, summer

			feeling wood houses

			Of South Carolina. A little boy casts his being up through the menace of being that.

			Here

			The snake oil volcano killer. Nigger slaver. Undesirable, you bet.

			Then to bare all that as far as it had riz, in him, to her, to find out

			Some bit of who it meant

			He was, would be. No, they don’t

			They didn’t NO. How could they

			Disarm the memory of that wonderful knowing (except the trial she bore

			Of a stupid negro vodka weening clumsy androgynous message from

			The white house, “We dig yall can be tilted toward the badness we acknowledge,

			and give you . . .)

			Like Silas Marner in High, yeh? School, the dark crowding up around his face,

			As he sat drunk, not, near, yeh, babbling about what ever he didn’t

			Understand.

			Georgia, Georgia, on my life, old slender, tall, straight, half-a-laughing Auntie

			Mine. There now, with negroes groveling for meaning, no, crawling out of

			themselves, back in themselves

			For feeling, not. The corniest things in the world

			Are boring.

			They couldn’t, all that time. Her fate was to be

			Ironic, in the midst of that. At herself. At them. The world. That’s why

			She talked so fast! That softly sharping

			“titter” that held the world somewhere, beyond arm’s length. Near the moon

			of whatever was her deep desire. Yet to be there, in that, and expecting it to

			desire her, as she, half consciously accepted what it was

			and the limitations to her streamlined rocket feeling self. Oh Jezus, Jezus,

			Jeeeezszus

			H. Christ. And

			that little boy looked into her face, and she into his, and what they didn’t

			understand of each other

			was what they loved most.

			But not this. Not this contemptuous disgust with life,

			The bookend Negro believes is love, my Jesus lord, not that,

			Or devotion. Please. No, don’t say that. Or

			Celebration, of a life

			They never, no they didn’t, don’t you understand? They

			Never understood.

			So they send me these horrible pictures, and what do they expect from me?

			except to be right

			again. They always are, but not about anything

			that matters.

			Georgia, Georgia, The Whole night through

			Just an old sweet song

			Keeps Georgia

			On my mind.

			Farewell sweet Auntie.





THE TERRORISM OF ABSTRACTION


			Why disappear & lie

			we can see you

			why cover everything

			w/ the sad victory

			of silence?

			Why pretend to see

			And only advertise blindness. Why

			Claim a tongue, ears, a

			Mouth & instead produce

			A tiny heart too jittery

			To beat. Why costume

			Feeling with bone shine

			& shallow glitter?

			Why lie an “I” & vanish

			Into parsed diction. Why

			Enhance an empty place

			With fantasy furniture

			& say it is the truth?

			Why not tell us something

			Other than the sound effects

			Of impotent evasion?

			Why make believe poetry

			Is about arrogant pretense

			& social denial. Why

			try to trick us you can sing?

			Why make words dull

			to conceal passive

			submission to

			Weak regret?





NO VOICE, DON’T GO, DON’T GO, VOICE ON A SCREEN IT STILL SEEM REAL, YET YOU KNOW IT’S REALLY GONE W/


			OUR MAN, PEDRO. The dark streak of this into that

			The Jones that came with his laugh, The Zorro hat, every body

			Shda knowd, Pedro. But, how cd they

			With poison Bush in our nose, they cdnt shdnt didn’t know

			Pedro. Some say he split, like re loaded he rose, in a plane

			so he cd go without the used up wings of myth or mister ology.

			And with him, with Pedro. Mustache, Si, the sloping always up roared eyes.

			The walk, the medals, for the bravery and courage to make war

			On yr outrage, oh midgets of stupidity. Pedro laughs at you, and we too because of him Laugh at you and his

			box “loose joints”

			Laugh at you in the telephone booths of replaced American hearts, from inside them Pedro makes the telephone

			booths laugh at you, The rubbers he threw

			At you in the Negro lady’s house laugh too. And the dead Hermanos y Hermanas laugh at you, even “without underwears”.

			So, why aint he here?

			How come he and Mikey, Vincent, Nina, went away? Who book

			They so. We can’t live without Pedro in black

			Giving corny people heart attack. How can it be?

			We left with out he? Pedro, El Bandito del Poesia

			El Zorro del Loisaida. The Nuyorican Beacon.

			El Reverendo Palante. Sermon Obit, some heavy shit. How the

			Mice was goin’ to parties and the bloods, Los Pueblo

			Tienen no Vida al todos. From mice to Rat

			The Dead Uniform let the Swine know where

			They at . . . There was no other being brought them Ricans here

			Where we cd see and hear they lives.

			The Obit made it clear.

			Juan, Miguel, Milagros,

			Olga, Manuel,

			buried in

			the empty box of Americans’

			missing soul.

			That was the passport called “Yo Tengo Puerto Rico En Mi Corazon”.

			That same church Felipe stood up in, where the Lords declared

			We were blood and kin. So then we have to see Pedro lying there

			Playin’ us like he sleep, when we know

			in a minute he gonna start running them telephone booth poems

			Its gon’ be deep.

			But did anybody laugh till they bend and weep.

			Anybody wake up baiting the darkness with disorder. Reversing the tied,

			So an ocean of Ha Ha’s turn us into waves of its rush.

			Who cd lose that and be the same, or stay sane, or find they brain.

			Pedro gotta be with us, he Deeper and funnier than El Senor.

			Pedro who walks sideways without moving

			Whose words were champion story tellers, who never lied,

			and told the truth on the installment plan.

			Whose shoes made him sing.

			Who jump start us with crack-up Vision,

			whose tunnel of mouth, Ha Ha Ha’d serious incision.

			That voice, that Latin Insomniac, Reverendo, black glove, razor sharp

			possessed perception must always be with us,

			that weapon

			of refusal to be locked down in the dull squalid mortuary of frowns

			of white frozen overhead toxic deadly

			America. Who lied to say we arrived, and all we see is slaves

			In the box car of history’s cold leftovers.

			That’s why Pedro wore them medals

			And gave the Puerto Rican passport to people made illegal aliens

			By they mind.

			Nothing can ever sound like Pedro at full blessed laugh.

			Nothing can bop they head up and down

			So the words mortar-shell across us screaming that revelation.

			Mix us together, Oh, Co-mix. Like The Djali sposed to do.

			Oh dark Taino Hermano of the stalking

			Guanguanco walk. The mystery shadow cover of meaning

			behind which he is coming while going,

			encircling the world with the machine gun of his words.

			A thousand suns a minute Bang Bang the night and day of this that

			into the force of Si, Aye, Eye, Yes and Of Course and Certainly and Yeh,

			and Amen Amen Amen.

			With that open embrace Elegba, Osiris, Orpheus, thus Djali, now Djali ya,

			Out of the darkness, his passion ultra-violet booms purple alphabets

			& split the night world into indigo lips

			as he blue blew the first sun rise and the first dawn

			whose chromatic ascension is the key board of human boom a looms

			So if he gone, he must come back nobody wanna live where it always night

			The voice and walk, and mustache, and eyes, and that raging live for what it is,

			es Verdad es Hermosa, nobody cant remove that day

			it lay in the box plotting

			Under that same hat the next sun’s laughing.

			So sit here with me

			in the other room

			after the church, the mud and snow and tears of the Bronx cemetery,

			after the worried highway of hello goodbye

			hugs kisses quiet cryings, after the flick, old friends,

			the beer wine rum Jack Daniels, hard smiles forced into sound, when the Nuyorican close down, this night

			with our sadness, at that bottom of ourselves

			where the silence has muscles.

			In a minute you will hear light,

			and see words flowing out of darkness

			like rich blue wine, and there will come that voice, the hat, that mustache

			and grinning ironic eyes, see, Si!

			Well what did you expect,

			the darkness fades away and there is the day

			with loose joints hanging from the sun burning with light

			Of course, it’s Elegba, Osiris, Orpheus, The Glee Man, back at they gig

			Then Everybody scream, “Hey Pedro, Man Where you been?”





WHOOSH!


			After The Rain

			I used to be simple

			When the world

			Was

			“When was that”?

			An LP after the ’45

			After the ’78

			When the sky was far away

			When humans had faces

			When the world minded

			Its own business

			& poetry was a dream

			that left no foot prints

			I used to be ignorant

			& thought I cd live

			without killing

			I used to be quiet

			I used to look at things

			& wonder

			that was before

			the war

			before the other

			war & the war

			before

			that.

			I used to be a child

			I got outta that

			I used to be excited

			By what I didn’t

			Understand

			I was still a child then

			Not yet a man

			I used to think I cd do anything

			But stuff I didn’t wanna

			Do

			I thought every body

			Had a heart, a soul,

			A brain, was sane

			I don’t mean some of what

			I saw & knew, & passed

			Wasn’t mean. But

			It didn’t mean

			What Monk mean

			When he thought up

			“I Mean You!”

			I never wanted to be anything

			But everything good. I thought

			I understood good. Like an appetite

			I might have, a beautiful feeling,

			A sound, a little girl her hair

			In a little curl, rolled

			Like an instant on her

			Forehead.

			I used to think

			Dead people

			wd always

			be dead.

			And you saw them

			If you had to

			just a moment

			at funerals.

			I stopped that

			I wont look at

			The funeral dead

			But instead I find the

			Dead, behind, to the left

			the right,

			& Straight ahead

			There’s a Dead thing

			With a pretzel

			Stuck in his cheek

			A ghost w/o a Sheet

			A murderer with an Ant Eater’s

			Beak. An ex-cartoon character

			In Muhammad Speaks

			w/ pointy ears, 2 Lugosi teefs

			stick out his ant eater mouf

			you lookin’ for that

			cute little tail

			he had

			When Gerald 2x

			Created him like Jacoub

			& Malcolm kept him

			jailed inside

			The Black Muslim

			Newspaper.

			I used to laugh at that

			Little devil, years after

			One told me

			Harlem smelled like

			The Elephant House

			at Bronx Zoo

			and I knew

			like he knew

			that he was

			tryin’ to hurt

			me.

			I used to cry

			if I had

			to lie.

			I used to think

			Every thing was its own

			Solution. That people

			Who put Colored People down

			Were just crazy. I don’t think

			I understood their power.

			I thought that Negroes

			Who “cut the fool”

			Were like a mysterious odor

			From a garbage can.

			I don’t think I ever really

			Believed in God

			I got baptized

			& nothing happened

			except I got wet

			& blinked my eyes

			at a preacher whiter

			than white people

			so I guess I thought

			he cd protect us

			from evil

			All this time

			In my zig zag

			Growing

			All this looking & feeling

			& eventually

			knowing

			Both me and the

			World

			Dig changing

			I used to be

			& so forth

			me & the

			world

			says

			cd say

			did say

			will say

			I used to, used to

			How did that word

			Come to mean that?





SPEAK TO ME THROUGH YOUR MOUTH


			Speak to me through your mouth

			Not the Daily Noose or Santa Claus fake animals

			I see on television. Speak to me in my ears. Loud enough

			For me to hear. Tell me what is the matter with us, why

			We are sitting here being directed to Hell by Ugly greedy

			Lying Zapalote, who claim you love them, that’s why they must

			Kill us. Talk to me out of your own brain not the box of idiots

			Whose eyes send odors through the tube, who have mastered the art

			Of telling the Beast where we live, so we can wake up grinning

			Tell me, look at me while you speak. Touch me to make sure we’re both here.

			Ask me a question and I’ll ask you one.

			Can we conversate for a minute

			Promise you won’t call me an egotistical dribble of unlikely desire.

			I won’t call you out your name. Call me through the windows of the evening.

			Can you sing? Then do that. A song we both know. What about the Internationale?

			You never heard of it?

			You want to sing Past Time Paradise? You’re not Stevie Wonder, Are you?

			Are you a friend or an enemy? My friend or my enemy. I’m a poet. I

			carry a RAZOR in my vest. You know Langston Hughes. You love Aimé Césaire. You can’t

			Play baseball, but you can box. You have on blue. You are covered

			everywhere with blue. Your eyes are indigo, are you a woman or a man.

			Why didn’t I ask you before?

			Before what? Is the door open to your heart? Can your lips play music?

			Are your fingers somewhere close? Do I know you? Have we ever met?

			How did you get there?

			I’m here where I am for a long time. The window loves me. How can I

			see you? You don’t care to see me? Why not? Ok, but still, speak to me

			through your mouth.

			I hope you’re not a priest or a detective.





JOHN ISLAND WHISPER


			I thinking cost you a window sees you

			In the sky of our limit is, our unsung unacknowledged

			Nation. O want us we being free we, like

			A star we staring, unseen and street is caring

			Want to know and do, and be that

			If we to, like singing so beautiful

			Blood is true. I wish, they say. And we wishes. Wishes

			Too. Is them a god, they tell us

			Is. No we ain’t but that which is

			Here and talked to

			Gesture stupid. Am arm clock faceless breath a song nobody know and

			we the words and the melody. Say it hymn ain’t singing them

			Is there singable me and you too. A singable love. A warm tune-ish be

			for us That eyes can hear the lowering happy the sun inside

			Be the overhead living





ALAS, POOR AUDEN, I KNEW HIM,


			A poet fiend of mine dropped this on me /// At a DC poetry soiree recently during the polemics on art & or VS politics, one disingenous ungenius quoted Auden to maintain that his work finally was just a tidier way of “wacking his doodle”. Yo boy’s reaction to dat follows.

			The Tragedy of Taste

			I would have sd to Auden,

			Reading the wasted tragedy of his repulsion

			from his own courage. How we can be backed up

			from love by the anonymous hatred rising off

			the streets like mist off the terra of the flat

			foolishness of wishing God did not exist under-

			standing He don’t Sayin he ain’t , then copping to

			The lie of your own dishonesty in the face of

			the fists of Ignorance which mock us con-

			cretely with windows and elevators.

			Poor Auden, to escape the Red Paint, he wd

			mumble “Poetry does nothing . . .”

			When, at least, it got him in trouble.

			Like the rest of us, willing to fight ugly, cuss

			ugly, smack ugly in its face, or talk bad to it

			in our house, or at some forgotten bar, where

			our spit rolled down the face of a denying

			grey flannel racist heart.

			Poor Auden, living a lie, his crying, his backed

			in the corner punkishness, as legacy and

			not at least, the sophistication of pre-

			Enlistment into “The Horror”, like

			Brando in the sunken hills and bleeding caves

			of inferno Viet-Nam

			Tricked by ego into joining The Monsters

			who let themselves be slaughtered to

			honor the prophecy of Revelations.

			Poor Auden, Remember how he sd of the search

			for fire, for the self-consciousness of coming humanity

			How he constumed its failure in his mind as

			The Greeks, wrapped in the tragedy of

			their own self predictions, a man “falling

			out the sky”, somehowing us that we

			could never discover the wisdom of our

			own being, subtracting our future with

			their icy truncations.

			Alas, to slay one’s father, push up on they own

			Mother, then on top of that

			cut they own eyes out so they could get outta

			Europe, head for the U.S. and make a deal

			with some African Negroes to buy slaves.

			Poor Auden, “Poetry Does Nothing”, He wept,

			closed in near Birdland, waiting for

			Pee Wee Marquette.

			Poor Auden, Finally to show up on the

			Lower East Side, closeted with Chester K.

			Winking at Frankie O & the others, whis-

			pered about, his betrayals become a robe

			of curiosity for those not yet bloodied by

			their own denials.

			“I sold out, Ok, I sold out!” A dude I knew,

			the newspapers called “A Genius” at 20,

			Thirty years later, He kneels

			in the hotel lobby, asking some Black poet

			to “forgive him”, for getting rich and having three houses,

			one in the Indian Territory. “Forgve me, Please!” He said.

			Ask, Auden, Poor Auden. What poetry does

			is leave you when you stop needing it!.

			At a funeral, a man I knew,

			A mysterious blonde, resourceful as the movies,

			as consort of the famous & glamorous

			wearing that like a toga of sunshine indoors.

			Alas, Auden, could be blanched, tho reddened, by the question,

			‘What are you doing?” A friend from his history in exile,

			‘Writing soap operas” twists into

			what bitter sophistication sells as smile . . .

			“The Young & The Restless”

			“Oh, Yeh!” the skinny history, in that still youthful

			anxiousness his casual watchers cannot see, Laughing,

			“Hey, man, how much they paying you?”

			It was no guile or mischief in that query, only another bit of

			information to

			give a base to any theory.

			But the glamorous blonde of now

			was daunted deep somehow, and with the chortle

			of quick steps out the back door of his

			feelings, sd, “Don’t ask me, It’s obscene!”

			Indeed, in a word, two syllables, Poor Auden.

			To leave a disgusting lie as signature

			A simple forgery in place of his soul

			Auden, Poor Guy, like himself at that bar half-drunk

			and sunk with half digust, for those who would not give up

			the Sweet filth of Sodom

			who’d rather be covered in that silken gore

			As glorified whore

			There, and likewise lauded

			in Gomorrah, like Weldon’s intelligent Darky

			Preferring disguise and a crown of lies

			Wanting himself seen only through a glass

			Darkly.

			As in, Poor Auden

			Poor Poor Auden.





NIGHTMARE BUSH’IT WHIRL


			Full of fiends, friends dyin’

			Why we cryin, was a zoomy yesterday power in they very sound,

			& the laughter & wild crying, they fightin’, keep tryin’, we usta know

			we was stronger than the devil insect brain. But teeth whirl, eat ya. Eat us. Whip

			whirl, hide under yr feets, bitin’ on top and underneath. Crazy stomping gurgle us

			world. Cd catch up. Malcolm. Could trap. Lumumba. Could dive down and beat,

			Biko. Could lie and Use stink from his very ass to kill, Toure, Nkrumah, Cd bite

			inside yellow pages

			Huntin’ for unemployed maniacs. Sibeko. Cd speak Portuguese

			Send poison fleas, Cabral. Cd white out mouth

			And sneak in as dressed up nothing, King. Cd yesterday themselves in afterwards

			the oh ohhs of hyena ghosts

			Crawling out dunce hats as the furniture polish of Watergate killers. Mao. Cd be

			wasted by the insanity of mistakes and

			The magnifiers of greenmail unrighteous left us prey. Stalin. Cd be lied about

			Or ignored, misused like diarrhea, clouding the world to a ho’s toilet, Lenin.

			Cd be studied to death in dust swept clean oh Marx Engels

			Under the academic Preyer rugs of

			Loyal opposition bedbugs, right, Mayakovsky, cd be olded

			By the torture of escaped assassination attempts, murders. “You know we shd’a

			killed you. You shd’a stayed w/ Fidel or

			The Chinese, Rob Wms. Where’s yr Negro gun now, the Ku Klux Klan in the white

			house, Dr., & Garvey didn’t send them there, Rabin dead in his own Jewish state

			Some of his own folks did the hate. Yitzak.

			Why this the whole ugly we have to eat or beat or flee or don’t see or disclaim we

			know its name

			Or be happy but insane. Was we always drugged and dead, Huey. Was we

			Always fat and fulla shit, OH Elephant? Was we always Crouched or

			midget Booker T’s hoping they cd intermarry silence in the 20th century.

			Was we always nostalgic failures

			Unable to sleep even when awake. Was we only Donald Duck opponents

			Of the mouth, in black beret dashikis, reappearing

			As baldhead charlatans in Rolls Royces, hot with the demagoguery

			Of deluded obsession? Was we always drop outs from the cp who turn up as Black nationalists

			Because we didn’t have no real childhood? Was we always bought and sold like

			cheap candy. Didn’t we never stand up straight or was we

			Even before the world split open and the frown sat over our head like heavy weather

			Walking in a crouch, to be near the man

			Who hadn’t even come out Jacoub’s test tube yet?

			Wes we always cannibals and scalpers like the white people really was

			Was we always the Remus who mama was a wolf and brother

			In the snow. Slay what. What you say. Ain’t gon’ be like this oh president named

			after a reefer, oh serial killer of

			The of revelation doom channel, watch the end. Where the beast get popped and the

			white horse white rider

			Be stopped, and Red Ryder and the Indian, make war with history

			Wait’in on the beboppers to arrive

			Eatin’ fish sammiches

			And talking the smack of

			Hard fact

			Won’t be no act

			No it wan be, can’t be like that, in history and now be the future befo’ you change

			Them nasty cash register drawers.

			Say I ain’t dreaming, this just ain’t screaming, what I say, what you say,

			Is this real or not, the beast got to be dropped

			A tombstone raise over his stink

			Say this backward dog thought he was God

			& dead is where his ugly led, he was much more evil

			than the future think, and got to be a cd inside the stone

			that holler out to all who approach

			You might still have some problems

			but none of em bad as the ghost!

			A World!





PROCERT


			In the dark unlicensed room

			The fear of light waylaid any thing except

			The people who didn’t know where anything was.

			They could whisper anything, to anything, but could not sing.

			Instead, the bled head, and the lies yet to be

			Said, collided inside the panorama of future amazement. They had seen

			The television, read the New York Times, listened to madmen and fools

			And wanted to laugh, if they had lips. So they sat under themselves and

			Tried to understand weeping.

			This was not Ramadan, or Christmas, or Yom Kippur, or The wooden jelly

			Bells of the old plantation when your relatives was there, considering murder.

			And Lo, that’s what they were, then, to them, and when that passed, they sat up

			Gasped a few notes that the critics, Shaitan bless’em, called “Rag”. And so passed into

			The great millennium of Nina Simone, singing, “Oh, Lord,

			Don’t let me be misunderstood!”

			The darkness wedged itself inside the colorless person’s throat, and when he sang

			It rang, bang-awang-gang. And silently, like truth, some youth put on different

			colors and made old people mad for having to feel like that all the time.

			The unsaid mischief of blue street dimly lit, where the footsteps hung

			So no one would mistake what they couldn’t see for what had never been.

			A lady like a magazine Bird, costumed in colors that whistled and stomped, preyed

			on the disarranged minds, a Wooly bully teeth & stomach smiled like weather

			reports and said stupid shit to confirm he was as important as the unswept floor of

			the colored church where everybody had to be happy because God was watching.

			You say, “I wanna Cry, but don’t let me die, cause I won’t lie, etcetera, smash.” No

			cataclysm except the bubbles.

			No crucifixion, except we had been lied to.

			“Let us know when we can sing”, you sd.

			“Nothing complex, like the Jelly Glass concertos, writ last semester when smiling

			was accepted.”

			So now in the same gloomish castle of unfettered conceit, where some Negroes won’t

			even eat meat, and others

			Have no teeth, and some more, got a cross they bore, and more than them, includes

			me and you, Jim.

			In that wrestled downpour of sudden silence, the lights pitter twinklings of dim

			regard. And lost people whine

			They have received no reward, and the logarithms of justice are unsolved

			And hide in wrinkled documents otherwise stuffed with lies

			And nobody got on a bathing suit or pilot goggles, and the statues

			Won’t move, since they too old, like Kenny G, to go to Iraq

			With “The Natives”. And the policemen won’t hold a decent conversation

			Before they pull the trigger. Bang Bang Bang, etcetera.

			Just a sliver of light, an innocent song, would save us. But alas, is that all

			In the past, with Movie heroes and the United States?

BIG FOOT


			Shaw Nuff

			If you ever saw Bird talking to

			Billy Shaw, about business, about

			pleasure, about cops and copping, or about anything

			You’d probably recognize Bird, that abstract expressionist

			Vine he always had on, Black stripes, Yellow stripes, No stripes

			Yet Bird never went to jail. A bunch of his running buddies, sycophants

			and dearest friends did, trying to be Like Bird. Trying to play that music.

			Because the music was Bird. It would come out of that glittering Ax

			and sail up through the top of the sky and carry all the diggers with it.

			So alot of people thought it was in them Yardish Ko Ko bags, or mixed up

			inside the stash, dropped in with the Skag and Vonce and Dooji and Mud.

			So a buncha mammy jammers mumbled the victrola needle into a poison spike.

			Even Bird, one night, at Birdland, was jabbing the flagpole deep into his vein

			and Dizzy peeped when the door flang open. And you know what Dizzy said,

			“Hey, that motherfucker in there shooting up!”

			The shit and the works leaped out of Bird’s mitts, and everything hit

			with a Zildjan bamalama Clang. And Bird, drugged and double drugged

			leaped next, up off the toilet seat, and out into the smoky crowd, careful

			as he split, not to run into the little “half a mammy jammer” Pres had named

			Entering the outside of Birdland, half high, embarrassed like BA his tail smoking

			but still grounded, down here fleeing the wouldbe alchemists of what it was.

			When they caught up with him, after America had burned to the ground, Bird

			was still warm. But as he explained, “I just did all that shit, to show you what not

			to do! You dig?” A few did.

			Confirmation

			This song will always be about Love

			for me. Bird knew, and told you too, when he played

			and the hip things stayed right inside your knot

			surrounding you at the same time, with the worlds future

			when human beings had finally copped. But then when the music

			stopped, and Bird became Charlie Parker, and the bright light of his

			Seeing was silent like Bach waiting for Be Bop, there was still Bird

			inside his knot, Confirming the Beauty of what is Beautiful and the

			distance ugliness was flung, by the frantic beat of a heart on fire with

			another hearts touching, His eyes seemed to whirl in slow funkishness

			seeing us and what was beyond us trying to explain.

			As weird as it is, Love is a form of knowledge, and any persons you say you love know

			you like you know them. My wife, Amina, is like that, for me, the heartbeat, like my

			own, and what it is is what it says and what it reaches is what it touches.

			Love is weird, like I say. It aint always still and humming, sometimes, like Bird

			its wants to wail and cant. And some other times, you feel it flying above you

			screaming how much it loves you. Yeh, It’s out.

			Buzzy

			was the obscene parable of my vanishing adolescence.

			You better get

			away from you because you always know what you think. You better get further

			and smell better. You better not ride the buzzard’s back, he’ll take you somewhere

			you cant get back. All them betters, used to play me like Ol man mose under the

			piano bench trying to cop what the others could not. And so I took it as other

			everything I heard from my father and mother. That it was, the word, like I had

			already heard Bird. Repetition was my introduction to face to face blood to blood

			profundity, psychological profanity and well advertised insanity. It was Charlie

			Parker, talking bout . . . “you better get yrself

			.” Oh, no, I will not say those sad words again. Whistling in the Hall

			like I would always be in college, every Fall. But Bird, I heard, when I had left the

			crib of my own distancing, and embraced my out as not the in it had been and the

			the rest of my feeling was not in concealing what I knew or wanted. And I was a real

			person, who bled and hurt, who didn’t inderstand a lot of things I needed to. When

			I copped, that dead Saturday of ancient heartbeat, the fact that it is the world that is

			in you and you in it. When I dug, that I must learn who I was by learning what the

			world was. . . . my blue insides spread like a thin glowing song all in front of me and my

			hands sparkled with what they knew they would do, whenever. Then I turned

			and walked back into my yet to be discovered life. A hip nigger kid, brighter than

			all the lights at Chanute Air Base and several ugly cities. And I felt myself leap

			and begin to experiment with flight. That night, it was in Chicago, I touched myself

			and felt myself and my head emptied and began to fill at the same time. And Buzzy,

			why he was off somewhere, tragically expiring in some ugly woman’s pad. And I,

			I’ll confess, wasn’t even sad. But I have been, often, since then. And this poem, makes

			me sad again.





FOUR CATS ON REPATRIATIONOLOGY


			Dude asked Monk

			If he was interested

			In digging

			The Mother

			Land

			Monk say,

			“I was in the

			Motherfuckin

			Mother Land

			before

			& some mother

			fucka

			brought me

			over here

			to play

			the

			mother

			fuckin

			piano. . . .

			You, dig?”

			A.#

			Another Dude

			Asked Duke

			the same question

			Was he, “interested

			In Digging

			The Mother

			Land?”

			Duke say, “Yeh

			I go there

			Every evening!”


B♭

			Same Blood

			Hit on Miles

			Like that

			“Say Miles

			You wanna go to

			The Mother

			Land?”

			“Yeh, tell her

			To call me!”


C.

			Same Dude ask

			Louis

			About Return

			To the Mother Land

			“Hey, My Man”,

			sd Louis

			“I aint never

			Left!”





WHERE IS THEM BLACK CLOTHES?


			I know

			They got em, some where

			in the back, them black suits

			they put on

			for the death head

			Attack, Them black suits

			With the high shiny boots,

			I know they already

			Got em, or they still being sewed

			In the back. So they can put em on

			In a snap. Like they jumped out

			The Bush bastard’s mouth

			In the middle of one of his

			Bush’it raps. “Attack! Attack!”

			A million assholes in black

			Is beatin on peoples doors

			Like they sellin crack.

			Destroyin peoples homes

			Like they doin in Iraq

			When they put on them black suits,

			Them uniforms, they got in

			The back, Ready when Bush

			Take off presidential grey for

			Fuhrer black, them suits

			they got in the back, ready

			for when Bush really scream

			ATTACK! Him, Cheney, Rums

			Field and the rest, they already

			Gottem, and yo girlfriend the skeeza

			Aint cutting no slack, she also

			gonna be dressed

			In Basic fascist Black





SMALL TALK IN THE MIRROR


			There is some kind of skeleton of ignorant greed

			Clutching our ears knows mouth where we breathe

			Not you, the other then, the one

			Who follows, the one who wont acknowledge

			The teeth in your tongue, the stomach in every song

			You have sung. Not them, what other grim doppelganger

			Wants to hang on your use, prays to our heart that

			We demand nothing smart, the fiend of our own living

			The one who keep shoving who us you is me them

			On toward a valley, an alley, a silly recompense

			At your own dumb expense. Say who is the why of our

			Lie, the under root of that untruth. Gaggle, babble, tattle, rattle, go on

			Skedaddle, swim or paddle from clean, be ugly, be mean

			Escape, say you weren’t on the scene, is ob and un seen, the next grim reaper

			Is the creature you have made.





RACE OR CLASS?


			Race or Class, is the stymieing contradiction

			Puzzling those who ponder Affirmative action.

			The black middle class, some say, has grown so strong

			As to make any social remuneration for that often crass

			Betraying bunch redundant, they have already copped

			That prize, for which millions of Bloods gave their lives.

			And there are white folks poor as dirt, who make even

			Some brothers and sisters in the projects look like they doing good.

			Oh yeh, is our reaction, water climbing up our nervous traceries

			But slavery still make it plain that black you was and black you is

			No matter what you gain. So yeh, we must include class consideration

			So that Colin Powell’s boring son do not cop at Little Abner Jr.’s expense,

			Right on. But I leave you with this burning fact which Du Bois

			Was wise enough to state, “Many have suffered as much as we

			But none of them was real estate!”





THOSE WHO DUG LESTER YOUNG

ARE NOT SURPRISED


			But those

			Who can’t understand

			What they did, can’t understand

			Who they are. Are then lost, in the moss, lost to the discourse

			Uncorrected, misdirected, uninspected, unprotected,

			never seen or known them or they, we and us, all, yall

			so then be unknown to most except the host

			who told them they ain’t who they is

			so insist they is who they ain’t, its quaint, just add

			a little paint, and say the same brain as the insane

			and not know, who you, who he, who we, blind like in Spanish

			can not si si see. As if race was a waste it is, horse number three ain’t none of we. And class

			was it true, others the same as you, but on your head, if you

			upside down, they underground, that’s cool, its romantic

			you get frantic, they answers antic, like the guy

			who crawl up out the bottle and want to know if you got his bubble.

			But pleas to make you understand, you is another breathing space

			who got they own time and place. Come this far in a minute.

			Ain’t even outta breath, come this far so soon, don’t know yrself

			Drunk some coon swoon, 145 years that’s a beginndin again

			44=08, start in 09 equals the time, and its 10, one again. Come so far so quick

			They forget to tell you wasn’t just slow you wasn’t just uneducated

			You was slick, you wasn’t just all heart, you was also very smart.

			How you think you was drug over here in chains, next thing we know

			You the president! God damn, you think you could survive amongst this hostile tribe

			and not be smart, plus tough, w/ all that heart. Those who dug Lester Young

			would understand. . . . Wha’s happenin, Prez?





NOTE TO SYLVIA ROBINSON FROM WHEN I SAW HER WALKING THROUGH THE PROJECTS IN 1969


			What beauty is not anomalous

			And strange, what love is not

			In danger and fragile, what goodness

			Is not sometimey and sweet, what grand

			Joyousness not shy and seeming incomplete

			We are what we can be together never enough

			Though without each other we don’t know our selves

			And would spend the rest of our days looking over our

			Shoulder at where we thought we saw ourselves

			Crossing another street.





MISSISSIPPI GODDAMN!


			There are some negroes

			Who will always be

			Negroes unless they turn into

			Something worse.

			There are some negroes who will always be

			Niggers, there are some negroes who will always

			Be slaves, coons, jiggaboos, woogies, any thing but

			Men and women able to think and understand

			How we have been dismantled in this land.

			I saw Hillary Clinton in Mississippi with two giant coons

			One on each side, like Mandrake the Magician

			With her own two Lothars . . . But by now, how could

			This cow lie, has slavery been so obscured, has that evil

			Been so cured, that two mindless swinish wooden negroes

			Could help the slavemasters mistress repeal the emancipation.

			Is this the meaning of integration or the effects of segregation.

			That we would rather guard capitalism’s whore than struggle

			For ourselves and with ourselves to achieve something more.





COMFORTABLE W/ INTELLIGENCE


			Inspired

			by consciousness

			made bold by

			human grandeur

			Why is it

			so much dumb stuff

			grows up around you?

			There is that space

			of breathing of heart beat

			going in & out

			that gives access

			to questions, wrong answers

			alcoholic fits

			distances of misunderstanding

			like the zoo of incompatible

			blindness, like correspondences

			of pain, propositions

			of ill lurking

			parades of falseness,

			maledict outright

			lies, whys to protect

			the unwise, suits against

			directness, litigation against

			openness, distortions

			bad thinking, stalling

			mumbles, castigated light

			Even so, we are comfortable

			w/ revelation, inspired

			by brilliant conversation

			raised up by the mention

			of intelligence, the longing for

			poetry of knowing, of doing

			of actual meaning,

			when & where it is

			anyway, despite the

			remarkable stupidity

			that encases the world

			in repetitious

			boring

			tragedy





PRESCRIPTION DRUG


			Rush, Limp Balls &

			His ass –ociate,

			The Lizard, run a

			Dumb show w/they boy

			The Chain, Which mean

			Steal links in his head

			Instead of a Brain!

			Too Dumb to be graduate

			Racists, they are still

			Studying Ugly but

			Seem to have succeeded

			In their seedy aspiration.

			The three in mufti

			Like the GOP trying

			To become the Klan

			Not trying, being, instead

			The KKK

			Krazy Korny Ksuckers

			Whose IQ collectively is

			Minus 8, whose

			Conversation is masturbation

			w/ early Neanderthal

			Accent, not smart

			Neanderthals but

			The dumb ones.

			And don’t forget the

			Fish egg Karl

			Who is what feces

			Becomes if not flushed

			Away he wants to stay

			Like the chain, Oh,

			Slave Memory!, in the

			News as old &

			Smelling like dead bodies

			Turning into mere odor.

			Shd we ignore them?

			We shd not only deplore

			Them, but insist they

			Be questioned, as I

			Shd have been when

			I made the Zionists angry.

			Yes, they need to be

			Summoned to court

			To explain the issue

			& what is they point.

			There must be a place

			A time, when racism

			Is a crime. where if

			The answers smack

			Of smack, not fact

			You get time for yr slime.

			Perhaps we shd

			Summon them to a

			People’s Tribunal

			Ok, Scream “Don’t Glorify

			The Urinal!”

			So let thousands have

			A chance to ask what

			They meant, where are their

			Facts, & I will submit

			To the same. Murdoch

			Too for his ugly cartoon

			Showing Obama slain

			By two cops! We need

			An assembly, a gathering

			Of the people to

			Ask questions of them,

			Of us, of myself.

			What are you talking about?

			What do you mean?

			And judge, let the grass

			Roots judge- & we will

			Go from there Yeh-

			What are you saying?

			What do you mean?

			& Where are the facts?





ALL SONGS ARE CRAZY


			Some are beautiful.

			Who could sing

			All the songs we know?

			How many of us that can, know

			How many of those who sing know

			What singing is.

			So I who have sung and have heard song

			Want to know the singers

			And the song

			I who have learned singing from the oldest singers

			In the world and have sung some songs myself

			Want to create that song that everybody knows

			And that everybody will sing one day.

			So what is left to do? That is how the song

			Begins.





I’M NOT FOOLED


			This is still Slavery

			Not fooled at all

			This is still slavery

			Even with OBAMA, I’M STILL NOT FOOLED

			THIS IS STILL SLAVERY, NOT FOOLED AT ALL

			IF IT WASN’T SLAVERY OBAMA COULD FIGHT BACK

			HE’S DONE THINGS, GOOD THINGS, BUT

			I’M STILL NOT FOOLED, THIS IS STILL SLAVERY.

			So what you gonna act like Miles, tellin me “So What?”

			Out yr brains closed mouth, and on the open streets

			Not only so what but bump me, chump me, chump us all, you say

			Actin like Miles but you aint Miles, you the dressed up slave master ghost

			Just as you always was. I ain’t fooled. It’s still slavery still is still is. I aint fooled

			Excuse me

			The fone ringing.





THE NEW INVASION OF AFRICA


			So it wd be this way

			That they wd get a negro

			To bomb his own home

			To join with the actual colonial

			Scum, Britain, France, add Poison Hillary

			With Israel and the Saudi to make certain

			That revolution in Africa must have a stopper

			So call in the white Euro people who long tasted our blood

			They would be the copper, overthrow Libya

			With some bullshit humanitarian scam

			With the negro yapping to make it seem right (far right)

			But that’s how Africa got enslaved by the white

			A negro selling his own folk, delivering us to slavery

			In the middle of the night.

			When will you learn poet

			And remember it so you know it

			Imperialism can look like anything

			Can be quiet and intelligent and even have

			A pretty wife. But in the end, it is insatiable

			And if it needs to, it will take your life.





WHAT’S THAT WHO IS THIS IN THEM OLD NAZI CLOTHES? NAZI’S DEAD


			I thought. I thought they said all them Nazis was outta here permanent.

			I remember 20 years ago I came into the city from the Holland tunnel and the vibe was strong

			I wrote, “I feel Nazis. There’s Nazi’s here.” And through

			The years I wd say it again sometimes pointing out specific things and vibes and even Creepus Dungus

			Like Rudy the Vile or Dubya the international murderer. But these

			Were in government, so when they left you breathed easier. But now

			These killers are not in the government, they say they don’t like the government

			that they enemies of the government. But what does that

			Mean. It means you can’t unelect them. Send them home to Texas to help vegetate the crops?

			And who are these brazens beings? They say they are people.

			They have the law on their side, saying they are humans just like us. But

			I saw a sign at the Occupy said if the Corporations are Human

			I wanna see Texas execute one! Then we’ll be sure. But not now, this

			Human cry is just a dumb ass lie, and you a fool to go for it! They are big time mechanized

			Telecommunicated gangs, whose sole purpose is to squeeze us for maximum profit. That’s their only reason, no matter with murder and treason. They send jobs to poor countries for criminal

			Pay, somebody call you for your phone bill, ask them where they from, India they say, not the Bronx.

			Look in your clothes, at those labels, for those jobs that they stole. Squeezing throats all over the

			world to make you unemployed and spread poverty throughout the world. It is not a coincidence

			That Wall Street was a plantation. Now they want to run the whole nation. Not as Weise Ubermensch

			The White Superman, with Adolph at the helm, but still as Fascist dictatorship, Superpacs, the Corpses uber alles. Not as government but over government, in place of government. Their leaders are Romneys, Rome’s knees. New Caesars on an International throne. On our knees before Rome again. Not with little Charlie Chaplin mustaches and easily satirized struts to force us into gas chambers and concentration camps, Just Buy! Sell! Completely Free (shudder when you hear them say that word) Free! to squander our lives for their gain. Paying no taxes, new mixmatch Himmlers like Tom Ass Clarence and his criminal wife praying to their non existent God which they count as they step through the blood giggling “Citizens United” the scalding song of vampires mumbling all over the world as they come to evict us from our homes and our schools, public education is on their hit list as well. Whether you speak Spanish or Greek whether it comes out of Christies mouth or Booker’s, Bloomberg or some other Freak. This the new anti fascist war we must fight, Against the rule of the Corpses. The Corporate Dictatorship forming in front of our eyes. It can no longer surprise. Get your pitch forks ready. Strike Hard and True. You get them or they get you.





SUPPOSE YOU BELIEVED THAT


			All this pain is necessary

			And that you had gotten

			Many awards saying you copped

			Because you can suffer

			Like a mimmy jimmy, better

			Than most

			And that you would receive

			A reward, up stairs, in the

			Upper Room, when you got to Hebin

			Hebin, and when the time came to split

			So you cd finally get your reward

			What you heard instead is a voice

			Coming from the top of the Empire

			State building, Chump, Chump, chump

			Then whatchu gonna do, this time, Bayyyyy

			Beee . . . Chump, Chump, Chump





BALLAD AIR & FIRE


			for Sylvia or Amina

			There is music

			sometimes

			in lonely

			shadows

			blue music

			sometimes

			purple music

			black music

			red music

			but these are left from crowds

			of people

			listening and singing

			from generation

			to generation

			All the civilizations humans have built

			(speed us up we look like ants)

			our whole lives lived in an inch

			or two. And those few seconds

			that we breathe

			in that incredible speed

			blurs of sight and sound

			the wind’s theories

			So for us to have been together, even

			for this moment

			profound like a leaf

			blown in the wind

			to have been together

			and known you, and despite our pain

			to have grasped much of what joy exists

			accompanied by the ring and peal of your

			romantic laughter

			is what it was about, really. Life.

			Loving someone, and struggling
